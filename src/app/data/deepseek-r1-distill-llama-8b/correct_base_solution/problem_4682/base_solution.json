  "solution": "Alright, so I have this problem here: When the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) is written in base 2, how many base-2 digits (bits) does it have? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to working with different bases, so I might need to take it slow.\n\nFirst, I know that base-16, or hexadecimal, uses digits from 0 to 9 and then A to F to represent values from 10 to 15. Each digit in a base-16 number represents a power of 16, just like each digit in base-10 represents a power of 10. So, for example, the number \\(66666_{16}\\) is actually \\(6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\\). That makes sense.\n\nBut the problem is asking about converting this number into base-2, which is binary. Binary uses only 0s and 1s, and each digit represents a power of 2. So, to find out how many bits \\(66666_{16}\\) has, I need to figure out the total number of bits required to represent the number in binary.\n\nI remember that one way to find the number of bits needed is to find the highest power of 2 that the number exceeds. The number of bits required will be one more than the exponent of the highest power of 2 needed. For example, if a number is between \\(2^n\\) and \\(2^{n+1} - 1\\), it will require \\(n+1\\) bits.\n\nSo, maybe I can first convert \\(66666_{16}\\) into base-10 and then figure out how many bits it takes in binary. That seems like a logical approach. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with \\(66666_{16}\\), I need to convert each digit to its base-10 equivalent and multiply by the appropriate power of 16. Since all the digits are 6, that should simplify things a bit.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The leftmost digit is 6, which is in the \\(16^4\\) place.\n- The next digit is 6, in the \\(16^3\\) place.\n- Then another 6 in the \\(16^2\\) place.\n- Another 6 in the \\(16^1\\) place.\n- The last digit is 6 in the \\(16^0\\) place.\n\nSo, in base-10, this would be:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(16^4\\), \\(16^3\\), \\(16^2\\), \\(16^1\\), and \\(16^0\\):\n\n- \\(16^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(16^1 = 16\\)\n- \\(16^2 = 256\\)\n- \\(16^3 = 4096\\)\n- \\(16^4 = 65536\\)\n\nOkay, so plugging these back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 65536 + 6 \\times 4096 + 6 \\times 256 + 6 \\times 16 + 6 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each multiplication:\n\n1. \\(6 \\times 65536 = 393216\\)\n2. \\(6 \\times 4096 = 24576\\)\n3. \\(6 \\times 256 = 1536\\)\n4. \\(6 \\times 16 = 96\\)\n5. \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n393,216 + 24,576 = 417,792\n\n417,792 + 1,536 = 419,328\n\n419,328 + 96 = 419,424\n\n419,424 + 6 = 419,430\n\nSo, \\(66666_{16}\\) is equal to 419,430 in base-10.\n\nNow, I need to find how many bits this number takes in binary. One way to find the number of bits is to use the logarithm base 2 of the number and take the ceiling of that value. The formula would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bits} = \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil\n\\]\n\nWhere N is the number in base-10.\n\nLet me compute \\(\\log_2(419,430)\\).\n\nI know that \\(2^{18} = 262,144\\) and \\(2^{19} = 524,288\\). So, 419,430 is between \\(2^{18}\\) and \\(2^{19}\\).\n\nTo get a better approximation, let me compute how much 419,430 is relative to 524,288.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference:\n\n524,288 - 262,144 = 262,144\n\nSo, 262,144 is \\(2^{18}\\), and 524,288 is \\(2^{19}\\).\n\n419,430 is 419,430 - 262,144 = 157,286 above \\(2^{18}\\).\n\nSo, 157,286 is how much more than \\(2^{18}\\). To find the log base 2, maybe I can use the logarithm formula or approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the natural logarithm and convert it to base 2.\n\nRecall that \\(\\log_b(a) = \\frac{\\ln a}{\\ln b}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\log_2(419,430) = \\frac{\\ln 419,430}{\\ln 2}\\).\n\nLet me compute \\(\\ln 419,430\\). Hmm, I might need a calculator for this, but since I don't have one, I can estimate it.\n\nI know that \\(\\ln 400,000\\) is approximately 12.296 (since \\(e^{12} \\approx 162,755\\), and \\(e^{13} \\approx 442,413\\)). So, 400,000 is between \\(e^{12}\\) and \\(e^{13}\\). Let me see:\n\n\\(e^{12} = 162,755\\)\n\n\\(e^{13} = 442,413\\)\n\nSo, 419,430 is between \\(e^{12}\\) and \\(e^{13}\\). Let's see how much it is.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n442,413 - 419,430 = 22,983\n\nSo, 419,430 is 22,983 less than 442,413.\n\nSo, perhaps approximately \\(e^{12.8}\\), but I need to estimate.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use linear approximation.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = ln(x). We know f(442,413) = 13, and f(419,430) is slightly less.\n\nCompute the derivative of ln(x) at x=442,413 is 1/442,413 \u2248 0.00000226.\n\nSo, the change in x is 442,413 - 419,430 = 22,983.\n\nTherefore, the change in f(x) \u2248 22,983 * 0.00000226 \u2248 0.052.\n\nSo, ln(419,430) \u2248 13 - 0.052 \u2248 12.948.\n\nSo, approximately 12.948.\n\nNow, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo, \\(\\log_2(419,430) = \\frac{12.948}{0.6931} \u2248 18.7\\).\n\nSo, approximately 18.7.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is the ceiling of 18.7, which is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because 2^18 is 262,144 and 2^19 is 524,288.\n\nSince 419,430 is between 2^18 and 2^19, but closer to 2^19.\n\nWait, but 2^18 is 262,144, 2^19 is 524,288. So, 419,430 is 419,430 - 262,144 = 157,286 above 2^18. So, it's 157,286 / 262,144 \u2248 0.6, so about 60% of the way from 2^18 to 2^19.\n\nSo, the log base 2 would be approximately 18.7, which makes sense.\n\nSo, since we need the number of bits, it's the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(N), which is 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits required is 19.\n\nWait, but I remember that when converting a number to binary, the number of bits required is one more than the highest power of 2 needed.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to compute the number of digits in binary by using the formula:\n\nNumber of digits = floor(log2(N)) + 1\n\nSo, if log2(N) is approximately 18.7, then floor(18.7) is 18, and adding 1 gives 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nBut let me try another approach to verify. Maybe converting the hexadecimal number directly to binary without going through base-10.\n\nI know that each hexadecimal digit can be represented by 4 binary digits, since 16 is 2^4. So, each hex digit is 4 bits. Therefore, if I have a 5-digit hexadecimal number, it would be 5 * 4 = 20 bits.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems conflicting with the previous result.\n\nWait, so if I have \\(66666_{16}\\), which is 5 digits in hex, then converting each digit to 4 bits would give 5 * 4 = 20 bits.\n\nBut earlier, by converting to base-10, I found that it's 19 bits.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nI need to figure out why.\n\nWait, maybe when you convert each hex digit to 4 bits, leading zeros might be added. So, perhaps the number in binary would have 20 bits, but if the leading digits are zero, they don't count. So, maybe it's actually 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me think. Each hex digit is 4 bits, so the total number of bits is 5 * 4 = 20. But depending on the value, the leading bits might not all be 1s.\n\nWait, so let's try converting the hex number to binary directly.\n\nEach hex digit corresponds to 4 bits:\n\n6 in hex is 0110 in binary.\n\nSo, let's write out each digit:\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\nSo, concatenating all these together:\n\n0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nSo, that would be:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nSo, that's 20 bits.\n\nBut wait, the first digit is 0, followed by 1. So, the leading 0 doesn't count as a significant bit.\n\nSo, the binary number would be 1 followed by the rest. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first 0 is insignificant because it's just padding. So, the significant bits start from the first 1.\n\nSo, counting the bits after the leading 0:\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nThat's 19 bits.\n\nAh, okay, so when converting each hex digit to 4 bits, you get 20 bits, but the leading zero is not counted, so the number of significant bits is 19.\n\nTherefore, both methods agree. So, the number of bits is 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19 bits.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try to compute the exact value of log2(419430) to be precise.\n\nI can use the natural logarithm approach.\n\nCompute ln(419430):\n\nI know that ln(400000) is approximately ln(4 * 10^5) = ln(4) + ln(10^5) = 1.386 + 11.513 = 12.899.\n\nBut 419430 is 19,430 more than 400,000.\n\nSo, using the approximation:\n\nln(419430) \u2248 ln(400000) + (19430 / 400000) * (1 / (400000 / 19430)) )\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to use the linear approximation.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = ln(x). Then, f'(x) = 1/x.\n\nSo, f(x + \u0394x) \u2248 f(x) + \u0394x * f'(x).\n\nSo, x = 400,000, \u0394x = 19,430.\n\nTherefore, ln(419,430) \u2248 ln(400,000) + 19,430 * (1 / 400,000)\n\nCompute 19,430 / 400,000 = 0.048575\n\nSo, ln(419,430) \u2248 12.899 + 0.048575 \u2248 12.947575\n\nSo, ln(419,430) \u2248 12.9476\n\nThen, log2(419,430) = ln(419,430) / ln(2) \u2248 12.9476 / 0.6931 \u2248 18.72\n\nSo, approximately 18.72, which we can round up to 19 bits.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute 2^18 and 2^19 to see where 419,430 stands.\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^15 = 32,768\n\n2^16 = 65,536\n\n2^17 = 131,072\n\n2^18 = 262,144\n\n2^19 = 524,288\n\nSo, 2^18 = 262,144\n\n2^19 = 524,288\n\n419,430 is between these two.\n\nCompute 419,430 / 262,144 \u2248 1.598, which is approximately 1.6.\n\nSo, 419,430 \u2248 1.6 * 262,144 \u2248 419,430.4\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, 419,430 is approximately 1.6 times 2^18, which is less than 2^19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the number of bits is 19.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. Maybe by using the formula for the number of digits in a certain base.\n\nThe number of digits \\(d\\) in base \\(b\\) required to represent a number \\(N\\) is given by:\n\n\\(d = \\lfloor \\log_b N \\rfloor + 1\\)\n\nSo, in this case, base \\(b = 2\\), number \\(N = 419,430\\)\n\nCompute \\(\\log_2(419,430)\\):\n\nAs we did earlier, approximately 18.72\n\nSo, floor(18.72) = 18\n\nTherefore, number of digits = 18 + 1 = 19\n\nSo, again, 19 bits.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, whether converting hex to binary directly or converting to base-10 first and then taking the log, I get the same answer: 19 bits.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe base-2 number has \\boxed{19} bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many base-2 digits (bits) the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has when written in base 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-16 number to base-10:**\n   \\[\n   66666_{16} = 6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\n   \\]\n   Calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 65536 = 393216\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4096 = 24576\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 256 = 1536\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 16 = 96\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 419430\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to binary:**\n   To find the number of bits required, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bits} = \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil\n   \\]\n   where \\(N = 419430\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the logarithm base 2:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_2(419430) \\approx 18.72\n   \\]\n   The number of bits is the ceiling of this value:\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 18.72 \\rceil = 19\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification by direct conversion:**\n   Each hexadecimal digit can be represented by 4 binary digits. The number \\(66666_{16}\\) has 5 digits, so converting each digit to 4 bits gives 20 bits. However, the leading zero is not counted, resulting in 19 significant bits.\n\nThus, the number of base-2 digits (bits) is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",

Because 2^18 is 262,144 and 2^19 is 524,288.\n\nSince 419,430 is between 2^18 and 2^19, but closer to 2^19.\n\nWait, but 2^18 is 262,144, 2^19 is 524,288. So, 419,430 is 419,430 - 262,144 = 157,286 above 2^18. So, it's 157,286 / 262,144 \u2248 0.6, so about 60% of the way from 2^18 to 2^19.\n\nSo, the log base 2 would be approximately 18.7, which makes sense.\n\nSo, since we need the number of bits, it's the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(N), which is 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits required is 19.\n\nWait, but I remember that when converting a number to binary, the number of bits required is one more than the highest power of 2 needed.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to compute the number of digits in binary by using the formula:\n\nNumber of digits = floor(log2(N)) + 1\n\nSo, if log2(N) is approximately 18.7, then floor(18.7) is 18, and adding 1 gives 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nBut let me try another approach to verify. Maybe converting the hexadecimal number directly to binary without going through base-10.\n\nI know that each hexadecimal digit can be represented by 4 binary digits, since 16 is 2^4. So, each hex digit is 4 bits. Therefore, if I have a 5-digit hexadecimal number, it would be 5 * 4 = 20 bits.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems conflicting with the previous result.\n\nWait, so if I have \\(66666_{16}\\), which is 5 digits in hex, then converting each digit to 4 bits would give 5 * 4 = 20 bits.\n\nBut earlier, by converting to base-10, I found that it's 19 bits.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nI need to figure out why.\n\nWait, maybe when you convert each hex digit to 4 bits, leading zeros might be added. So, perhaps the number in binary would have 20 bits, but if the leading digits are zero, they don't count. So, maybe it's actually 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me think. Each hex digit is 4 bits, so the total number of bits is 5 * 4 = 20. But depending on the value, the leading bits might not all be 1s.\n\nWait, so let's try converting the hex number to binary directly.\n\nEach hex digit corresponds to 4 bits:\n\n6 in hex is 0110 in binary.\n\nSo, let's write out each digit:\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\n6 -> 0110\n\nSo, concatenating all these together:\n\n0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nSo, that would be:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nSo, that's 20 bits.\n\nBut wait, the first digit is 0, followed by 1. So, the leading 0 doesn't count as a significant bit.\n\nSo, the binary number would be 1 followed by the rest. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first 0 is insignificant because it's just padding. So, the significant bits start from the first 1.\n\nSo, counting the bits after the leading 0:\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nThat's 19 bits.\n\nAh, okay, so when converting each hex digit to 4 bits, you get 20 bits, but the leading zero is not counted, so the number of significant bits is 19.\n\nTherefore, both methods agree. So, the number of bits is 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19 bits.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try to compute the exact value of log2(419430) to be precise.\n\nI can use the natural logarithm approach.\n\nCompute ln(419430):\n\nI know that ln(400000) is approximately ln(4 * 10^5) = ln(4) + ln(10^5) = 1.386 + 11.513 = 12.899.\n\nBut 419430 is 19,430 more than 400,000.\n\nSo, using the approximation:\n\nln(419430) \u2248 ln(400000) + (19430 / 400000) * (1 / (400000 / 19430)) )\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to use the linear approximation.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = ln(x). Then, f'(x) = 1/x.\n\nSo, f(x + \u0394x) \u2248 f(x) + \u0394x * f'(x).\n\nSo, x = 400,000, \u0394x = 19,430.\n\nTherefore, ln(419,430) \u2248 ln(400,000) + 19,430 * (1 / 400,000)\n\nCompute 19,430 / 400,000 = 0.048575\n\nSo, ln(419,430) \u2248 12.899 + 0.048575 \u2248 12.947575\n\nSo, ln(419,430) \u2248 12.9476\n\nThen, log2(419,430) = ln(419,430) / ln(2) \u2248 12.9476 / 0.6931 \u2248 18.72\n\nSo, approximately 18.72, which we can round up to 19 bits.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute 2^18 and 2^19 to see where 419,430 stands.\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n2^15 = 32,768\n\n2^16 = 65,536\n\n2^17 = 131,072\n\n2^18 = 262,144\n\n2^19 = 524,288\n\nSo, 2^18 = 262,144\n\n2^19 = 524,288\n\n419,430 is between these two.\n\nCompute 419,430 / 262,144 \u2248 1.598, which is approximately 1.6.\n\nSo, 419,430 \u2248 1.6 * 262,144 \u2248 419,430.4\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, 419,430 is approximately 1.6 times 2^18, which is less than 2^19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the number of bits is 19.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. Maybe by using the formula for the number of digits in a certain base.\n\nThe number of digits \\(d\\) in base \\(b\\) required to represent a number \\(N\\) is given by:\n\n\\(d = \\lfloor \\log_b N \\rfloor + 1\\)\n\nSo, in this case, base \\(b = 2\\), number \\(N = 419,430\\)\n\nCompute \\(\\log_2(419,430)\\):\n\nAs we did earlier, approximately 18.72\n\nSo, floor(18.72) = 18\n\nTherefore, number of digits = 18 + 1 = 19\n\nSo, again, 19 bits.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, whether converting hex to binary directly or converting to base-10 first and then taking the log, I get the same answer: 19 bits.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe base-2 number has \\boxed{19} bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many base-2 digits (bits) the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has when written in base 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-16 number to base-10:**\n   \\[\n   66666_{16} = 6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\n   \\]\n   Calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 65536 = 393216\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4096 = 24576\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 256 = 1536\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 16 = 96\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 419430\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to binary:**\n   To find the number of bits required, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bits} = \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil\n   \\]\n   where \\(N = 419430\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the logarithm base 2:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_2(419430) \\approx 18.72\n   \\]\n   The number of bits is the ceiling of this value:\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 18.72 \\rceil = 19\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification by direct conversion:**\n   Each hexadecimal digit can be represented by 4 binary digits. The number \\(66666_{16}\\) has 5 digits, so converting each digit to 4 bits gives 20 bits. However, the leading zero is not counted, resulting in 19 significant bits.\n\nThus, the number of base-2 digits (bits) is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
