The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? Solution: \n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to figure out how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the book has pages numbered from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I don't have to worry about multiple copies or anything like that. The question is specifically about the digits 4 and 8, and how many more times 4 appears compared to 8 in all these page numbers.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. So, we have page numbers that are 1-digit (1-9), 2-digits (10-99), and 3-digits (100-488). I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these categories and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the 1-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 will each appear once. So, both 4 and 8 have 1 occurrence here. That means, up to page 9, the count of 4's and 8's is equal.\n\nMoving on to the 2-digit page numbers, from 10 to 99. Now, this is where it gets a bit more complex. In the tens place and the units place, 4 and 8 can each appear multiple times.\n\nLet me first think about the tens place. From 10 to 99, the tens digit cycles through 1 to 9, each repeated 10 times. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 will appear in the numbers 80-89, which is also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in every block of 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 19, the units digit cycles through 0-9, same for 20-29, and so on up to 90-99. Therefore, for each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place and the digit 8 also appears once.\n\nThere are 9 sets of 10 numbers from 10-99, right? Because 99-10+1=90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 9 times, and the digit 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, combining the tens and units place for 2-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- For 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nSo, in the 2-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Still, they are equal.\n\nNow, let's move on to the 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit trickier because the hundreds, tens, and units places can all have 4's and 8's, and we need to count each occurrence.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The page numbers go from 100 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- The hundreds digit is 1 for numbers 100-199: 100 numbers.\n- Similarly, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (since the book ends at 488). So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for the 3-digit numbers.\n\nThe tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each block of 10 numbers. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. Wait, actually, for each hundred block, there are 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times (each digit appearing 10 times in the tens place per hundred block).\n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, so the last hundred block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers. So, we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me handle each hundred block separately.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - Tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n   - So, for 4's in the tens place: 10 times (140-149)\n   - For 8's in the tens place: 10 times (180-189)\n   \n2. 200-299:\n   - Similarly, 4's in the tens place: 10 times (240-249)\n   - 8's in the tens place: 10 times (280-289)\n   \n3. 300-399:\n   - 4's in the tens place: 10 times (340-349)\n   - 8's in the tens place: 10 times (380-389)\n   \n4. 400-488:\n   - Now, here we have 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0-8 nine times and then 0-9 for the last partial block.\n   \n   Wait, actually, let's think about it. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 for each hundred. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers, and then for 9, it's only 8 numbers (480-488). So, for 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n   - For 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can only go up to 8. Wait, no, 440 is in 400-488, right? Because 440 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\n   So, in 400-488:\n   - 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449)\n   - 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488)\n   \nTherefore, summing up the tens place for 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40\n- For 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place. So, 10 each x 3 blocks = 30 for both. Then, in 400-488, 4's contribute 10 and 8's contribute 9. So, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for the 3-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly to the tens place, the units digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut again, in the last hundred block (400-488), it's only 89 numbers, so the units digit cycles through 0-8 nine times, and then 9 once more (480-488). Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Each complete set of 10 numbers (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489) would have units digits 0-9, but since we only go up to 488, the last partial set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n- Each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears once (in 480-488, the units digit goes from 0-8 for 480-488, but wait, actually, 480-488: units digits are 0-8, so digit 9 doesn't appear here. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, digits 0-8 each appear once in the units place here, right? Wait, but actually, each units digit from 0-8 appears once in each set of 10 numbers, but since we have 9 sets (since 89 divided by 10 is 8 full sets and a partial set of 9). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that in 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 nine times, but the last cycle is cut off at 488, so the units digits go from 0-8 in the last partial cycle. Therefore, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in the units place, and digit 9 appears 8 times (since 480-488 has units digits 0-8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the units place here). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 digits, each appearing once. So, digits 0-8 appear once each in the units place in the last partial cycle, and digit 9 doesn't appear here.\n\nBut wait, that would mean in 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (from 8 full cycles) plus once in the partial cycle, totaling 10 times. But that can't be because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) plus 9 numbers. Each full cycle contributes 10 numbers, but the units digits in each full cycle are 0-9, so each digit appears once per cycle. So, in 8 full cycles, each digit appears 8 times. Then, in the partial cycle (9 numbers: 480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once. So, in total, digits 0-8 appear 8 + 1 = 9 times each in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 400-488) has 100 numbers. If we were to have a complete hundred block, each digit 0-9 would appear 10 times in the units place. But since we have only 89 numbers, it's incomplete.\n\nSo, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full cycle, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, after 8 full cycles, each digit 0-9 has appeared 8 times in the units place.\n\nThen, in the extra 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once more. So, digits 0-8 have 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences in the units place, and digit 9 has only 8 occurrences (since in 488, the units digit is 8, not 9). Wait, no, 488 is the last number, so 488 is the 89th number. So, 480 is the first, which is 480, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, 480-488: units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers, each with units digits 0-8. So, digit 9 does not appear in the units place in the last partial cycle. Therefore, digit 9 appears only 8 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488: in the units place, digit 9 appears in 490-499, but since we only go up to 488, digit 9 doesn't appear in the units place in 400-488. So, digit 9 appears only in 400-488 in the hundreds place, but not in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this. How many times does digit 9 appear in the units place in 400-488? The numbers ending with 9 in 400-488 would be 409, 419, 429, 439, 449, 459, 469, 479, 489. But 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 479. So, numbers are 409, 419, 429, 439, 449, 459, 469, 479. That's 8 numbers. So, digit 9 appears 8 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- In 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n- Digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't add up because 9 digits (0-8) each appearing 9 times would be 81, plus 8 for digit 9, totaling 89, which is correct because there are 89 numbers.\n\nSo, to break it down:\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: How many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n  - In 100-199: 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194)\n  - In 200-299: 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294)\n  - In 300-399: 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394)\n  - In 400-488: 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484)\n  \n  So, total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n- For 8's: Similarly,\n  - In 100-199: 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198)\n  - In 200-299: 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298)\n  - In 300-399: 10 times (308, 318, ..., 398)\n  - In 400-488: 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488)\n  \n  So, total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, but in the tens and units place, they do. But from the calculations, both 4's and 8's have 39 in the units place for 3-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear. In the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times. In the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times. So, total for 4's:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal for 8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTherefore, in the 3-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nWait, let me verify this again because I might have made a mistake in the units place counts.\n\nIn the units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the units place, so 10 each for 4 and 8. So, 10 * 3 = 30 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times as well? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in 400-488, units digits go from 0-8 for the last partial set, so 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is also 9 times. So, in the units place for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each.\n\nTherefore, total units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, total for 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal for 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nSo, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? That would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, 188 - 98 is 90. Hmm, that seems quite a lot, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 1-digit numbers:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\n2-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 10 each\n- Units place: 9 each\nTotal: 19 each\n\n3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Units place: 39 for each\nTotal: 168 for 4, 78 for 8\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, okay, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think about the 3-digit numbers again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, except for the last block where 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, so total 40 for 4 and 39 for 8.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, except for the last block where both appear 9 times, so total 39 for each.\n\nSo, that's 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's in the 3-digit numbers. That's correct.\n\nAdding the 1 and 2-digit numbers, we get 188 and 98, respectively.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **1-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Total for 4's: 1\n   - Total for 8's: 1\n\n2. **2-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Units place: Each digit appears 9 times (once in each block of 10 numbers).\n   - Total for 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n   - Total for 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\n3. **3-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 does not appear.\n   - Tens place: Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and in the last block (400-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n     - Total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n     - Total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Units place: Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and in the last block (400-488), each digit appears 9 times.\n     - Total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n     - Total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n4. **Summing up the occurrences:**\n   - For 4's:\n     - 1-digit: 1\n     - 2-digit: 19\n     - 3-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - For 8's:\n     - 1-digit: 1\n     - 2-digit: 19\n     - 3-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.",
  "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: Each page number of a 488-page book is printed one time in the book.  The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this math problem here: I need to figure out how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the book has pages numbered from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I don't have to worry about multiple copies or anything like that. The question is specifically about the digits 4 and 8, and how many more times 4 appears compared to 8 in all these page numbers.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. So, we have page numbers that are 1-digit (1-9), 2-digits (10-99), and 3-digits (100-488). I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these categories and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the 1-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 will each appear once. So, both 4 and 8 have 1 occurrence here. That means, up to page 9, the count of 4's and 8's is equal.\n\nMoving on to the 2-digit page numbers, from 10 to 99. Now, this is where it gets a bit more complex. In the tens place and the units place, 4 and 8 can each appear multiple times.\n\nLet me first think about the tens place. From 10 to 99, the tens digit cycles through 1 to 9, each repeated 10 times. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 will appear in the numbers 80-89, which is also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in every block of 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 19, the units digit cycles through 0-9, same for 20-29, and so on up to 90-99. Therefore, for each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place and the digit 8 also appears once.\n\nThere are 9 sets of 10 numbers from 10-99, right? Because 99-10+1=90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 9 times, and the digit 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, combining the tens and units place for 2-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- For 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nSo, in the 2-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Still, they are equal.\n\nNow, let's move on to the 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit trickier because the hundreds, tens, and units places can all have 4's and 8's, and we need to count each occurrence.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The page numbers go from 100 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- The hundreds digit is 1 for numbers 100-199: 100 numbers.\n- Similarly, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (since the book ends at 488). So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for the 3-digit numbers.\n\nThe tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each block of 10 numbers. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. Wait, actually, for each hundred block, there are 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times (each digit appearing 10 times in the tens place per hundred block).\n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, so the last hundred block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers. So, we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me handle each hundred block separately.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - Tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n   - So, for 4's in the tens place: 10 times (140-149)\n   - For 8's in the tens place: 10 times (180-189)\n   \n2. 200-299:\n   - Similarly, 4's in the tens place: 10 times (240-249)\n   - 8's in the tens place: 10 times (280-289)\n   \n3. 300-399:\n   - 4's in the tens place: 10 times (340-349)\n   - 8's in the tens place: 10 times (380-389)\n   \n4. 400-488:\n   - Now, here we have 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0-8 nine times and then 0-9 for the last partial block.\n   \n   Wait, actually, let's think about it. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 for each hundred. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers, and then for 9, it's only 8 numbers (480-488). So, for 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n   - For 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can only go up to 8. Wait, no, 440 is in 400-488, right? Because 440 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\n   So, in 400-488:\n   - 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449)\n   - 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488)\n   \nTherefore, summing up the tens place for 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40\n- For 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place. So, 10 each x 3 blocks = 30 for both. Then, in 400-488, 4's contribute 10 and 8's contribute 9. So, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for the 3-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly to the tens place, the units digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut again, in the last hundred block (400-488), it's only 89 numbers, so the units digit cycles through 0-8 nine times, and then 9 once more (480-488). Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Each complete set of 10 numbers (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489) would have units digits 0-9, but since we only go up to 488, the last partial set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n- Each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears once (in 480-488, the units digit goes from 0-8 for 480-488, but wait, actually, 480-488: units digits are 0-8, so digit 9 doesn't appear here. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, digits 0-8 each appear once in the units place here, right? Wait, but actually, each units digit from 0-8 appears once in each set of 10 numbers, but since we have 9 sets (since 89 divided by 10 is 8 full sets and a partial set of 9). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that in 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 nine times, but the last cycle is cut off at 488, so the units digits go from 0-8 in the last partial cycle. Therefore, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in the units place, and digit 9 appears 8 times (since 480-488 has units digits 0-8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the units place here). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 digits, each appearing once. So, digits 0-8 appear once each in the units place in the last partial cycle, and digit 9 doesn't appear here.\n\nBut wait, that would mean in 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (from 8 full cycles) plus once in the partial cycle, totaling 10 times. But that can't be because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) plus 9 numbers. Each full cycle contributes 10 numbers, but the units digits in each full cycle are 0-9, so each digit appears once per cycle. So, in 8 full cycles, each digit appears 8 times. Then, in the partial cycle (9 numbers: 480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once. So, in total, digits 0-8 appear 8 + 1 = 9 times each in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 400-488) has 100 numbers. If we were to have a complete hundred block, each digit 0-9 would appear 10 times in the units place. But since we have only 89 numbers, it's incomplete.\n\nSo, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full cycle, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, after 8 full cycles, each digit 0-9 has appeared 8 times in the units place.\n\nThen, in the extra 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once more. So, digits 0-8 have 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences in the units place, and digit 9 has only 8 occurrences (since in 488, the units digit is 8, not 9). Wait, no, 488 is the last number, so 488 is the 89th number. So, 480 is the first, which is 480, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, 480-488: units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers, each with units digits 0-8. So, digit 9 does not appear in the units place in the last partial cycle. Therefore, digit 9 appears only 8 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488: in the units place, digit 9 appears in 490-499, but since we only go up to 488, digit 9 doesn't appear in the units place in 400-488. So, digit 9 appears only in 400-488 in the hundreds place, but not in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nBut wait, let's confirm this. How many times does digit 9 appear in the units place in 400-488? The numbers ending with 9 in 400-488 would be 409, 419, 429, 439, 449, 459, 469, 479, 489. But 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 479. So, numbers are 409, 419, 429, 439, 449, 459, 469, 479. That's 8 numbers. So, digit 9 appears 8 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- In 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n- Digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't add up because 9 digits (0-8) each appearing 9 times would be 81, plus 8 for digit 9, totaling 89, which is correct because there are 89 numbers.\n\nSo, to break it down:\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4's: How many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n  - In 100-199: 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194)\n  - In 200-299: 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294)\n  - In 300-399: 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394)\n  - In 400-488: 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484)\n  \n  So, total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n- For 8's: Similarly,\n  - In 100-199: 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198)\n  - In 200-299: 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298)\n  - In 300-399: 10 times (308, 318, ..., 398)\n  - In 400-488: 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488)\n  \n  So, total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, but in the tens and units place, they do. But from the calculations, both 4's and 8's have 39 in the units place for 3-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear. In the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times. In the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times. So, total for 4's:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal for 8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTherefore, in the 3-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nWait, let me verify this again because I might have made a mistake in the units place counts.\n\nIn the units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the units place, so 10 each for 4 and 8. So, 10 * 3 = 30 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times as well? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in 400-488, units digits go from 0-8 for the last partial set, so 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is also 9 times. So, in the units place for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each.\n\nTherefore, total units place for 3-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, total for 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal for 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nSo, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? That would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, 188 - 98 is 90. Hmm, that seems quite a lot, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 1-digit numbers:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\n2-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 10 each\n- Units place: 9 each\nTotal: 19 each\n\n3-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Units place: 39 for each\nTotal: 168 for 4, 78 for 8\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, okay, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think about the 3-digit numbers again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, except for the last block where 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, so total 40 for 4 and 39 for 8.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, except for the last block where both appear 9 times, so total 39 for each.\n\nSo, that's 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's in the 3-digit numbers. That's correct.\n\nAdding the 1 and 2-digit numbers, we get 188 and 98, respectively.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **1-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Total for 4's: 1\n   - Total for 8's: 1\n\n2. **2-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Units place: Each digit appears 9 times (once in each block of 10 numbers).\n   - Total for 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n   - Total for 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\n3. **3-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 does not appear.\n   - Tens place: Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and in the last block (400-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n     - Total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n     - Total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Units place: Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and in the last block (400-488), each digit appears 9 times.\n     - Total for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n     - Total for 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n4. **Summing up the occurrences:**\n   - For 4's:\n     - 1-digit: 1\n     - 2-digit: 19\n     - 3-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - For 8's:\n     - 1-digit: 1\n     - 2-digit: 19\n     - 3-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.",
