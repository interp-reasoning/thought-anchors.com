    "So, now, considering the units place across all 3-digit numbers:\n- From 100-199: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.",
    "So, for 400-488:\n   - Digit 4 in units place: 9 times\n   - Digit 8 in units place: 9 times\n   - Digit 9: 8 times, but we don't need that for our problem.",
