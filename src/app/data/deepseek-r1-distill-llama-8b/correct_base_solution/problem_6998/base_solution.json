  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the x-intercepts of a function are the points where the function crosses the x-axis, which means y = 0. So, I need to solve the equation sin(1/x) = 0 for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nAlright, when does sin(\u03b8) equal zero? Well, sine of an angle \u03b8 is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = k\u03c0 where k is an integer. So, substituting \u03b8 with 1/x, I get 1/x = k\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(k\u03c0).\n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I have to find all integers k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that inequality down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nHmm, let me solve for k. Maybe it's easier if I flip the inequalities because when I take reciprocals, the direction of the inequalities will change.\n\nStarting with the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0). If I take reciprocals, this becomes k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Wait, but since 0.0001 is positive, the inequality direction remains the same when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive. So, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) implies that k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, the right part: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, this becomes k\u03c0 > 1/0.001.\n\nSo, putting it together, we have:\n\n1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating the numerical values:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000,\n1/0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing through by \u03c0 to solve for k:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.\n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, k must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut k has to be an integer, so k must satisfy the inequality:\n\n319 \u2264 k \u2264 3183.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Since 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309..., the next integer greater than that is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098..., so the largest integer less than that is 3183.\n\nTherefore, k can take integer values from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from both ends: 319 - 318 = 1, and 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that might not be the correct way.\n\nActually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, it's 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 integer values of k such that x = 1/(k\u03c0) lies within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hence, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Start with sin(1/x) = 0 => 1/x = k\u03c0 => x = 1/(k\u03c0). Correct.\n\n2. Then, find x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. Correct.\n\n3. Taking reciprocals, remembering to reverse inequalities: k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000 and k\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. Correct.\n\n4. So, 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000 => 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0. Calculated 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Correct.\n\n5. Therefore, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Correct.\n\n6. Number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem solid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to solve the equation \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).
