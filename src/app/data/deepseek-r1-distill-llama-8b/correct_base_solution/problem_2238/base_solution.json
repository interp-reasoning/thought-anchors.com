  "solution": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the original problem also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have any effect on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or is it separate?\n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in the first part, and \\(c\\) is a different variable in the second part, when we multiply them together, the terms in the expansion will involve products of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. But the question specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider whether multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, hold on. When multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients of like terms are multiplied. But here, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, if we are only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to see if any of the terms in the second expansion will result in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by a term from the first expansion.\n\nLooking at \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms are \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5/c\\), \\(c^4/c^2\\), \\(c^3/c^3\\), and \\(c^2/c^4\\), right? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6.\n\nWait, so when we multiply each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of specific terms multiply. However, in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms with \\(c^k\\). But since \\(c\\) is a different variable, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expansion would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expression of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, is the question asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), or is it asking for a numerical coefficient? Since the problem is presented in this way, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), and find the coefficient.\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is still a function of \\(c\\).\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is actually miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe it's expecting me to consider only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that's multiplied by \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, let me think again. If we have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) in the second, then when we multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), its coefficients are actually the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) terms, which are the terms in the expansion. So, if I denote the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as \\(P(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times \\(P(c)\\). But since \\(P(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), this would mean the coefficient is 6 times that polynomial. But the question is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, not an expression in terms of another variable.\n\nTherefore, maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the problem is actually only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. Wait, but \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely since the question is presented in a way that suggests a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied. Let me check: the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, they are multiplied together.\n\nWait, but in the entire expression, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5/c\\), \\(c^4/c^2\\), \\(c^3/c^3\\), \\(c^2/c^4\\), etc. But each of these terms has different exponents of \\(c\\), so when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5/c = a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4/c^2 = a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^3/c^3 = a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2/c^4 = a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), and so on.\n\nTherefore, in the entire expression, there are multiple terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to find the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of zero.\n\nTherefore, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so is the coefficient 120? Let me double-check that.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent is zero. As I calculated earlier, that happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, after this lengthy thought process, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately.\n\nFirst, we use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",

Wait, does the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have any effect on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or is it separate?\n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in the first part, and \\(c\\) is a different variable in the second part, when we multiply them together, the terms in the expansion will involve products of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms.

So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so is the coefficient 120? Let me double-check that.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent is zero. As I calculated earlier, that happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, after this lengthy thought process, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately.\n\nFirst, we use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
