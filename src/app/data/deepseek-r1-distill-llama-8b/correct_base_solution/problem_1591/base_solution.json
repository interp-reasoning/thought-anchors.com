  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem about Dr. Fu Manchu's bank account. It says that the account has an annual interest rate of 6 percent, but it compounds monthly. I need to find the equivalent annual interest rate, r percent, that would give the same return as the monthly compounding. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n t \\]\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, the interest is compounded monthly, so n would be 12. The annual interest rate is 6 percent, which is 0.06 in decimal. Since it's compounded monthly, the monthly rate would be \\( \\frac{0.06}{12} \\).\n\nWait, but I need to find the equivalent annual rate, r, that compounds once a year but gives the same total amount as the monthly compounding. So, I think I need to set up an equation where the amount from monthly compounding equals the amount from annual compounding.\n\nLet me denote the principal as P. After t years, the amount with monthly compounding would be:\n\\[ A_{\\text{monthly}} = P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 t} \\]\n\nAnd the amount with annual compounding would be:\n\\[ A_{\\text{annual}} = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^t \\]\n\nSince these two amounts are supposed to be equal, I can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 t} = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^t \\]\n\nHmm, the principal P cancels out, so that simplifies things. So we have:\n\\[ \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 t} = \\left(1 + r\\right)^t \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for r. Since t is the time in years, but it's not specified here. Wait, is t given? Let me check the problem again. It just says the bank account has an annual interest rate of 6 percent, compounds monthly. So, I think t is 1 year because we're comparing the rates for the same time period.\n\nSo, if t = 1, the equation becomes:\n\\[ \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 1} = \\left(1 + r\\right)^1 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\nFirst, \\( \\frac{0.06}{12} \\) is the monthly interest rate. Let me calculate that:\n\\( 0.06 \\div 12 = 0.005 \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ (1 + 0.005)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nNow, I need to compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\). Hmm, I think I can do this by calculating step by step or using logarithms, but maybe I can approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the effective annual rate (EAR) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\]\nWhere r is the annual nominal rate and n is the number of compounding periods per year.\n\nIn this case, r is 0.06 and n is 12. So plugging in:\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = (1.005)^{12} - 1 \\]\n\nSo, I need to compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\). Let me try to calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, I can compute \\( 1.005^2 \\):\n\\( 1.005 \\times 1.005 = 1.010025 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 1.010025^2 \\) is:\n\\( 1.010025 \\times 1.010025 \\approx 1.020150 \\)\n\nWait, that's \\( 1.005^4 \\). Let me see if I can find a pattern or use logarithms.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the natural logarithm and exponential function to compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me take the natural log of both sides:\n\\( \\ln(1.005^{12}) = 12 \\ln(1.005) \\)\n\nCompute \\( \\ln(1.005) \\). I know that \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\approx x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - \\dots \\) for small x. Since 0.005 is small, I can approximate it.\n\nSo, \\( \\ln(1.005) \\approx 0.005 - (0.005)^2/2 + (0.005)^3/3 \\)\nCalculate each term:\nFirst term: 0.005\nSecond term: \\( (0.005)^2 / 2 = 0.000025 / 2 = 0.0000125 \\)\nThird term: \\( (0.005)^3 / 3 = 0.000000125 / 3 \u2248 0.0000000417 \\)\n\nSo, adding up:\n0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000417 \u2248 0.0049875417\n\nSo, \\( \\ln(1.005) \u2248 0.0049875 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 12 \\times 0.0049875 \u2248 0.05985 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\ln(1.005^{12}) \u2248 0.05985 \\)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to get \\( 1.005^{12} \u2248 e^{0.05985} \\)\n\nCompute \\( e^{0.05985} \\). I know that \\( e^{0.06} \u2248 1.06183654 \\). Since 0.05985 is slightly less than 0.06, the value will be slightly less than 1.06183654.\n\nLet me compute \\( e^{0.05985} \\). Let me use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0.06.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use linear approximation. The derivative of e^x is e^x, so the slope at x=0.06 is e^{0.06} \u2248 1.06183654.\n\nSo, the linear approximation for e^{0.05985} is:\n\n\\( e^{0.06} + (0.05985 - 0.06) \\times e^{0.06} \\)\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the linear approximation is:\n\n\\( e^{a + h} \u2248 e^{a} + h e^{a} \\)\n\nHere, a = 0.06 and h = -0.00015 (since 0.05985 = 0.06 - 0.00015)\n\nSo, \\( e^{0.05985} \u2248 e^{0.06} + (-0.00015) e^{0.06} \\)\n\u2248 1.06183654 - 0.00015 * 1.06183654\n\u2248 1.06183654 - 0.000159775\n\u2248 1.06167676\n\nSo, approximately 1.06167676\n\nTherefore, \\( 1.005^{12} \u2248 1.06167676 \\)\n\nThus, the effective annual rate is:\n\\( 1.06167676 - 1 = 0.06167676 \\)\n\nConvert that to a percentage:\n0.06167676 * 100 \u2248 6.167676%\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest hundredth, that would be 6.17%\n\nWait, let me check if my approximation is accurate enough.

So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for effective annual rate directly:\nEAR = (1 + (0.06/12))^12 - 1\n= (1.005)^12 - 1\nWhich we've computed as approximately 6.16778%\n\nSo, r is approximately 6.17% when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLet me just verify if I did everything correctly. The key was setting the two compounding methods equal over the same time period, which is one year. So, after one year, both accounts should have the same amount. Since the monthly compounding gives a slightly higher amount due to compounding more frequently, the equivalent annual rate needs to be higher than 6%, which it is, 6.17%.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 6.17%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) percent that would give the same return as the monthly compounding of an annual interest rate of 6 percent, we use the formula for compound interest.\n\nFirst, we note that the monthly interest rate is:\n\\[ \\frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \\]\n\nThe amount of money accumulated after one year with monthly compounding is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{monthly}} = P \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{12} \\]\n\nWe need this to be equal to the amount accumulated after one year with annual compounding:\n\\[ A_{\\text{annual}} = P \\left(1 + r\\right) \\]\n\nSetting these equal, we get:\n\\[ \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\left(1.005\\right)^{12} \\) step by step, we find:\n\\[ \\left(1.005\\right)^{12} \\approx 1.0616778 \\]\n\nThus, the effective annual rate \\( r \\) is:\n\\[ r = 1.0616778 - 1 = 0.0616778 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:\n\\[ r \\approx 6.17\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.17}\n\\]",

Alternatively, I can compute \\( 1.005^{12} \\) more precisely.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\nStart with 1.005\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.010025 + 1.010025*0.005 \u2248 1.010025 + 0.005050125 \u2248 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 \u2248 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.015075125 + 1.015075125*0.005 \u2248 1.015075125 + 0.005075375625 \u2248 1.020150500625\n\n1.005^5 \u2248 1.020150500625 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150500625 + 1.020150500625*0.005 \u2248 1.020150500625 + 0.0051007528125 \u2248 1.0252512534375\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.0252512534375 * 1.005 \u2248 1.0252512534375 + 1.0252512534375*0.005 \u2248 1.0252512534375 + 0.00512625671875 \u2248 1.03037751015625\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.03037751015625 * 1.005 \u2248 1.03037751015625 + 1.03037751015625*0.005 \u2248 1.03037751015625 + 0.00515188755078125 \u2248 1.0355293977066406\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.0355293977066406 * 1.005 \u2248 1.0355293977066406 + 1.0355293977066406*0.005 \u2248 1.0355293977066406 + 0.0051776469832303 \u2248 1.040707044689871\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040707044689871 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040707044689871 + 1.040707044689871*0.005 \u2248 1.040707044689871 + 0.005203535224444 \u2248 1.045910579914315\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.045910579914315 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045910579914315 + 1.045910579914315*0.005 \u2248 1.045910579914315 + 0.0052295529595708 \u2248 1.0511401328748858\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.0511401328748858 * 1.005 \u2248 1.0511401328748858 + 1.0511401328748858*0.005 \u2248 1.0511401328748858 + 0.005255700664444 \u2248 1.0563958335393298\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.0563958335393298 * 1.005 \u2248 1.0563958335393298 + 1.0563958335393298*0.005 \u2248 1.0563958335393298 + 0.00528197916716965 \u2248 1.0616778127064995\n\nSo, after calculating step by step, \\( 1.005^{12} \u2248 1.0616778127064995 \\), which is approximately 1.0616778\n\nTherefore, the effective annual rate is:\n1.0616778 - 1 = 0.0616778, which is 6.16778%\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, that's 6.17%\n\nWait, so earlier approximation gave me 6.17%, and the step-by-step calculation also gave me 6.16778%, which rounds to 6.17%. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for effective annual rate directly:\nEAR = (1 + (0.06/12))^12 - 1\n= (1.005)^12 - 1\nWhich we've computed as approximately 6.16778%\n\nSo, r is approximately 6.17% when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLet me just verify if I did everything correctly. The key was setting the two compounding methods equal over the same time period, which is one year. So, after one year, both accounts should have the same amount. Since the monthly compounding gives a slightly higher amount due to compounding more frequently, the equivalent annual rate needs to be higher than 6%, which it is, 6.17%.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 6.17%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.17}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) percent that would give the same return as the monthly compounding of an annual interest rate of 6 percent, we use the formula for compound interest.\n\nFirst, we note that the monthly interest rate is:\n\\[ \\frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \\]\n\nThe amount of money accumulated after one year with monthly compounding is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{monthly}} = P \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{12} \\]\n\nWe need this to be equal to the amount accumulated after one year with annual compounding:\n\\[ A_{\\text{annual}} = P \\left(1 + r\\right) \\]\n\nSetting these equal, we get:\n\\[ \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\left(1.005\\right)^{12} \\) step by step, we find:\n\\[ \\left(1.005\\right)^{12} \\approx 1.0616778 \\]\n\nThus, the effective annual rate \\( r \\) is:\n\\[ r = 1.0616778 - 1 = 0.0616778 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:\n\\[ r \\approx 6.17\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.17}\n\\]",
