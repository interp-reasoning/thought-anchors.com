  "solution": "Okay, so I need to figure out this interest rate problem. Dr. Fu Manchu has a bank account with an annual interest rate of 6 percent, but it compounds monthly. I need to find the equivalent annual interest rate, r percent, that would give the same return if it were compounded annually instead. Hmm, I remember something about effective annual rate from my studies. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, compound interest. When interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective annual rate (EAR) is higher than the nominal rate. In this case, the nominal rate is 6%, but it's compounded monthly. So, to find the EAR, I should use the formula for compound interest and then find the equivalent annual rate.\n\nThe compound interest formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount.\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\nBut in this problem, I don't know the principal or the amount, but I guess since we're looking for the equivalent rate, the principal and the amount after a year should be the same for both compounding methods. So, if I consider the amount after one year with monthly compounding, it should equal the amount after one year with annual compounding.\n\nLet me denote:\n- \\( P \\) as the principal.\n- \\( A_{monthly} \\) as the amount after one year with monthly compounding.\n- \\( A_{annual} \\) as the amount after one year with annual compounding.\n\nSince both are for one year, I can set them equal:\n\n\\[ A_{monthly} = A_{annual} \\]\n\nSubstituting the compound interest formula for both:\n\n\\[ P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = P \\left(1 + r \\right) \\]\n\nOkay, so the P cancels out:\n\n\\[ \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nSo, to find r, I can subtract 1 from both sides and then subtract 1 again? Wait, let's write it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the inside of the left side:\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{0.06}{12} = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ (1.005)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( (1.005)^{12} \\). I think I can do this using logarithms or a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, I'll try to remember that the formula for compound interest also relates to the effective annual rate. So, if I can compute \\( (1 + \\frac{r_{monthly}}{12})^{12} \\), that gives the factor by which the principal grows in one year, and then I can set that equal to \\( 1 + r_{annual} \\), where \\( r_{annual} \\) is the effective annual rate.\n\nSo, let me compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\). I know that \\( \\ln(1.005) \\) is approximately 0.004975. So, using the exponential function, \\( e^{12 \\times 0.004975} \\). Let me compute 12 * 0.004975 first.\n\n12 * 0.004975 = 0.0597\n\nSo, \\( e^{0.0597} \\) is approximately equal to... Hmm, I remember that \\( e^{0.06} \\) is about 1.0618. So, 0.0597 is just slightly less than 0.06, so the result will be slightly less than 1.0618. Maybe around 1.0615 or something.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it step by step:\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = (1.005)(1.005) = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 \u2248 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150501\n\n1.005^5 \u2248 1.020150501 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251002\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.025251002 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030301502\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.030301502 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035355506\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.035355506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040408016\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040408016 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045461025\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.045461025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.050525126\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.050525126 * 1.005 \u2248 1.055600127\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.055600127 * 1.005 \u2248 1.060660127\n\nSo, approximately 1.060660127.\n\nTherefore, \\( (1.005)^{12} \u2248 1.06066 \\). So, that's equal to \\( 1 + r \\), so \\( r = 1.06066 - 1 = 0.06066 \\), which is 6.066%.\n\nBut the question asks for the rate to the nearest hundredth, so that would be 6.07%.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation because earlier I thought it was about 1.0615, but when I computed step by step, it's about 1.06066. So, 1.06066 is approximately 1.0607 when rounded to four decimal places, but since we need to find r to the nearest hundredth, we can take 1.06066 as approximately 1.0607, so r is 0.0607, which is 6.07%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for EAR directly. The effective annual rate formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\]\n\nSo, plugging in r = 0.06 and n = 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 \\]\n\nWhich is exactly what we did before, and we found that to be approximately 0.06066, so 6.066%, which rounds to 6.07%.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should use a calculator to compute (1.005)^12 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest and calculate it step by step.\n\nLet me try computing 1.005 multiplied 12 times.\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 = 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150501\n\n1.005^5 = 1.020150501 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251002\n\n1.005^6 = 1.025251002 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030301502\n\n1.005^7 = 1.030301502 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035355506\n\n1.005^8 = 1.035355506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040408016\n\n1.005^9 = 1.040408016 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045461025\n\n1.005^10 = 1.045461025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.050525126\n\n1.005^11 = 1.050525126 * 1.005 \u2248 1.055600127\n\n1.005^12 = 1.055600127 * 1.005 \u2248 1.060660127\n\nSo, as we can see, it's approximately 1.060660127. So, subtracting 1 gives us 0.060660127, which is 6.0660127%. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 6.07%.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is 6.07%.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me compute it using logarithms.\n\nWe have \\( (1 + \\frac{0.06}{12})^{12} = e^{12 \\ln(1.005)} \\).\n\nCompute \\( \\ln(1.005) \\). Using Taylor series approximation, ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ...\n\nx = 0.005, so ln(1.005) \u2248 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 - (0.005)^4 / 4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.005 = 0.005\n\n(0.005)^2 = 0.000025, so 0.000025 / 2 = 0.0000125\n\n(0.005)^3 = 0.000000125, so /3 \u2248 0.0000000416667\n\n(0.005)^4 = 0.000000000625, so /4 \u2248 0.00000000015625\n\nSo, ln(1.005) \u2248 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000416667 - 0.00000000015625 \u2248 0.004987541\n\nTherefore, ln(1.005) \u2248 0.004987541\n\nMultiply by 12: 12 * 0.004987541 \u2248 0.059849692\n\nSo, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^{0.05976} is approximately 1.0615, since ln(1.0615) \u2248 0.05976.\n\nWait, let me recall that e^{0.06} \u2248 1.06183654.\n\nSo, 0.059849692 is very close to 0.06, just slightly less.\n\nSo, let me compute e^{0.059849692}.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around 0.06:\n\nLet me set x = 0.06, and we have e^{x - 0.000150308}.\n\nSo, e^{x - \u0394x} \u2248 e^x * e^{-\u0394x} \u2248 e^{0.06} * (1 - \u0394x + (\u0394x)^2 / 2 - ... )\n\nCompute \u0394x = 0.06 - 0.059849692 = 0.000150308\n\nSo, e^{-\u0394x} \u2248 1 - \u0394x + (\u0394x)^2 / 2\n\n\u2248 1 - 0.000150308 + (0.000150308)^2 / 2\n\n\u2248 0.999849692 + 0.00000001118\n\n\u2248 0.999849703\n\nTherefore, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 e^{0.06} * 0.999849703 \u2248 1.06183654 * 0.999849703 \u2248\n\nCompute 1.06183654 * 0.999849703:\n\nFirst, 1.06183654 * 1 = 1.06183654\n\nSubtract 1.06183654 * 0.000150308:\n\n1.06183654 * 0.000150308 \u2248 0.00015959\n\nSo, 1.06183654 - 0.00015959 \u2248 1.06167695\n\nTherefore, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 1.06167695\n\nSo, that's approximately 1.061677.\n\nWhich is about 1.06168, so \\( 1.06168 - 1 = 0.06168 \\), which is 6.168%. So, that's approximately 6.17%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated step by step, it was about 1.06066, which is 6.066%, which is 6.07%.\n\nHmm, so now I'm getting two different results: 6.07% vs 6.17%. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps my logarithm approach is introducing some error because I used an approximation for ln(1.005). Maybe it's better to use a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the effective annual rate is 6.06%, and when rounded to the nearest hundredth, it's 6.07%.\n\nWait, let's see. The exact value is (1.005)^12.\n\nIf I compute this using a calculator:\n\n1.005^12.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 = 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150501\n\n1.005^5 \u2248 1.020150501 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251002\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.025251002 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030301502\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.030301502 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035355506\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.035355506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040408016\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040408016 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045461025\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.045461025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.050525126\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.050525126 * 1.005 \u2248 1.055600127\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.055600127 * 1.005 \u2248 1.060660127\n\nSo, (1.005)^12 \u2248 1.060660127, so 1.06066, which is approximately 6.066%, so 6.07% when rounded.\n\nTherefore, the correct effective annual rate is approximately 6.07%.\n\nSo, the confusion came from the logarithm approximation, which gave me 6.17%, but the step-by-step multiplication gave me 6.066%, which is 6.07%. So, I think the step-by-step is more accurate here.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is 6.07%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.07}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) percent for a bank account that compounds monthly at an annual interest rate of 6 percent, we need to calculate the effective annual rate (EAR).\n\nThe compound interest formula for monthly compounding is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n \\]\nwhere \\( r = 0.06 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\).\n\nWe need to find the equivalent annual rate \\( r \\) such that:\n\\[ P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = P \\left(1 + r \\right) \\]\n\nThe principal \\( P \\) cancels out, so we have:\n\\[ \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nCalculating the inside of the left side:\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{0.06}{12} = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ (1.005)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nUsing step-by-step multiplication to find \\( (1.005)^{12} \\):\n\\[ 1.005^1 = 1.005 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^2 = 1.010025 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^3 = 1.015075125 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^4 \\approx 1.020150501 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^5 \\approx 1.025251002 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^6 \\approx 1.030301502 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^7 \\approx 1.035355506 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^8 \\approx 1.040408016 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^9 \\approx 1.045461025 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{10} \\approx 1.050525126 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{11} \\approx 1.055600127 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{12} \\approx 1.060660127 \\]\n\nThus, \\( (1.005)^{12} \\approx 1.06066 \\), so:\n\\[ 1 + r = 1.06066 \\]\n\\[ r = 1.06066 - 1 = 0.06066 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest hundredth:\n\\[ r \\approx 6.07\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.07}.",

The effective annual rate formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n - 1 \\]\n\nSo, plugging in r = 0.06 and n = 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 \\]\n\nWhich is exactly what we did before, and we found that to be approximately 0.06066, so 6.066%, which rounds to 6.07%.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should use a calculator to compute (1.005)^12 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest and calculate it step by step.\n\nLet me try computing 1.005 multiplied 12 times.\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 = 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150501\n\n1.005^5 = 1.020150501 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251002\n\n1.005^6 = 1.025251002 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030301502\n\n1.005^7 = 1.030301502 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035355506\n\n1.005^8 = 1.035355506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040408016\n\n1.005^9 = 1.040408016 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045461025\n\n1.005^10 = 1.045461025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.050525126\n\n1.005^11 = 1.050525126 * 1.005 \u2248 1.055600127\n\n1.005^12 = 1.055600127 * 1.005 \u2248 1.060660127\n\nSo, as we can see, it's approximately 1.060660127. So, subtracting 1 gives us 0.060660127, which is 6.0660127%. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 6.07%.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is 6.07%.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me compute it using logarithms.\n\nWe have \\( (1 + \\frac{0.06}{12})^{12} = e^{12 \\ln(1.005)} \\).\n\nCompute \\( \\ln(1.005) \\). Using Taylor series approximation, ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ...\n\nx = 0.005, so ln(1.005) \u2248 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 - (0.005)^4 / 4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.005 = 0.005\n\n(0.005)^2 = 0.000025, so 0.000025 / 2 = 0.0000125\n\n(0.005)^3 = 0.000000125, so /3 \u2248 0.0000000416667\n\n(0.005)^4 = 0.000000000625, so /4 \u2248 0.00000000015625\n\nSo, ln(1.005) \u2248 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000416667 - 0.00000000015625 \u2248 0.004987541\n\nTherefore, ln(1.005) \u2248 0.004987541\n\nMultiply by 12: 12 * 0.004987541 \u2248 0.059849692\n\nSo, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^{0.05976} is approximately 1.0615, since ln(1.0615) \u2248 0.05976.\n\nWait, let me recall that e^{0.06} \u2248 1.06183654.\n\nSo, 0.059849692 is very close to 0.06, just slightly less.\n\nSo, let me compute e^{0.059849692}.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around 0.06:\n\nLet me set x = 0.06, and we have e^{x - 0.000150308}.\n\nSo, e^{x - \u0394x} \u2248 e^x * e^{-\u0394x} \u2248 e^{0.06} * (1 - \u0394x + (\u0394x)^2 / 2 - ... )\n\nCompute \u0394x = 0.06 - 0.059849692 = 0.000150308\n\nSo, e^{-\u0394x} \u2248 1 - \u0394x + (\u0394x)^2 / 2\n\n\u2248 1 - 0.000150308 + (0.000150308)^2 / 2\n\n\u2248 0.999849692 + 0.00000001118\n\n\u2248 0.999849703\n\nTherefore, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 e^{0.06} * 0.999849703 \u2248 1.06183654 * 0.999849703 \u2248\n\nCompute 1.06183654 * 0.999849703:\n\nFirst, 1.06183654 * 1 = 1.06183654\n\nSubtract 1.06183654 * 0.000150308:\n\n1.06183654 * 0.000150308 \u2248 0.00015959\n\nSo, 1.06183654 - 0.00015959 \u2248 1.06167695\n\nTherefore, e^{0.059849692} \u2248 1.06167695\n\nSo, that's approximately 1.061677.\n\nWhich is about 1.06168, so \\( 1.06168 - 1 = 0.06168 \\), which is 6.168%. So, that's approximately 6.17%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated step by step, it was about 1.06066, which is 6.066%, which is 6.07%.\n\nHmm, so now I'm getting two different results: 6.07% vs 6.17%. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps my logarithm approach is introducing some error because I used an approximation for ln(1.005). Maybe it's better to use a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the effective annual rate is 6.06%, and when rounded to the nearest hundredth, it's 6.07%.\n\nWait, let's see. The exact value is (1.005)^12.\n\nIf I compute this using a calculator:\n\n1.005^12.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 = 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150501\n\n1.005^5 \u2248 1.020150501 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251002\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.025251002 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030301502\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.030301502 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035355506\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.035355506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040408016\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040408016 * 1.005 \u2248 1.045461025\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.045461025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.050525126\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.050525126 * 1.005 \u2248 1.055600127\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.055600127 * 1.005 \u2248 1.060660127\n\nSo, (1.005)^12 \u2248 1.060660127, so 1.06066, which is approximately 6.066%, so 6.07% when rounded.\n\nTherefore, the correct effective annual rate is approximately 6.07%.\n\nSo, the confusion came from the logarithm approximation, which gave me 6.17%, but the step-by-step multiplication gave me 6.066%, which is 6.07%. So, I think the step-by-step is more accurate here.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is 6.07%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.07}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) percent for a bank account that compounds monthly at an annual interest rate of 6 percent, we need to calculate the effective annual rate (EAR).\n\nThe compound interest formula for monthly compounding is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n \\]\nwhere \\( r = 0.06 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\).\n\nWe need to find the equivalent annual rate \\( r \\) such that:\n\\[ P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = P \\left(1 + r \\right) \\]\n\nThe principal \\( P \\) cancels out, so we have:\n\\[ \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nCalculating the inside of the left side:\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{0.06}{12} = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ (1.005)^{12} = 1 + r \\]\n\nUsing step-by-step multiplication to find \\( (1.005)^{12} \\):\n\\[ 1.005^1 = 1.005 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^2 = 1.010025 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^3 = 1.015075125 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^4 \\approx 1.020150501 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^5 \\approx 1.025251002 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^6 \\approx 1.030301502 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^7 \\approx 1.035355506 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^8 \\approx 1.040408016 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^9 \\approx 1.045461025 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{10} \\approx 1.050525126 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{11} \\approx 1.055600127 \\]\n\\[ 1.005^{12} \\approx 1.060660127 \\]\n\nThus, \\( (1.005)^{12} \\approx 1.06066 \\), so:\n\\[ 1 + r = 1.06066 \\]\n\\[ r = 1.06066 - 1 = 0.06066 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest hundredth:\n\\[ r \\approx 6.07\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.07}.",
