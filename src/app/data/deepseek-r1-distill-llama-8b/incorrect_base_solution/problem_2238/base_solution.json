  "solution": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, since the exponent is 4, I can write \\((a + b)^4\\) as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That looks like another binomial expansion. So, using the same idea, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of two expansions, I need to consider how these coefficients interact. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, that might not be entirely correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiplied by the polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's a scalar coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, we'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{6 - 2m - m} = c^{6 - 3m}\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 3m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not as part of a combined expression, I think we might need to consider that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. If that's the case, then the coefficient is simply 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first expansion, and the rest is multiplied by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to clarify.\n\nIn the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the scalar coefficient 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that \\(c\\) is a constant, so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the expansion, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But that's not how coefficients work. Coefficients are scalars, so if you have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients. But in reality, in polynomial multiplication, each term is unique in its exponents, so actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar. So, perhaps the question is intended to consider that \\(c\\) is a constant, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a number, not a function.\n\nWait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nLet me check that approach. If we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all its coefficients, and then multiplying that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply the two expansions, each term \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) is multiplied by each term \\(c^{6 - 3m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 3m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 3m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient when considering all the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables. But in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients multiplied by the respective \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that \\(c\\) is a constant, so then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, that's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to clarify the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a function of \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a scalar. So, perhaps the question is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product of two polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that \\(c\\) is a specific value, but it's not given. So, I think the only way to get a scalar coefficient is to evaluate the entire expression at a specific value of \\(c\\). For example, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64 times 6, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the intended answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by expanding both expressions.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem,\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1c^6\\)\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- For \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. However, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of those terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the respective terms \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all these coefficients: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1.\n\nCalculating that sum: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply together to form that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would be a polynomial, so unless we evaluate it at a specific value of \\(c\\), we can't get a scalar coefficient.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 64, and then multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nI think I've considered multiple approaches and they all lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThis expansion results in:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is:\n\\[\n1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\).",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem to solve: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, since the exponent is 4, I can write \\((a + b)^4\\) as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That looks like another binomial expansion. So, using the same idea, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of two expansions, I need to consider how these coefficients interact. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, that might not be entirely correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiplied by the polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's a scalar coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, we'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{6 - 2m - m} = c^{6 - 3m}\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 3m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not as part of a combined expression, I think we might need to consider that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. If that's the case, then the coefficient is simply 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first expansion, and the rest is multiplied by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to clarify.\n\nIn the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the scalar coefficient 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that \\(c\\) is a constant, so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the expansion, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But that's not how coefficients work. Coefficients are scalars, so if you have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients. But in reality, in polynomial multiplication, each term is unique in its exponents, so actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar. So, perhaps the question is intended to consider that \\(c\\) is a constant, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a number, not a function.\n\nWait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nLet me check that approach. If we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all its coefficients, and then multiplying that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply the two expansions, each term \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) is multiplied by each term \\(c^{6 - 3m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 3m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 3m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient when considering all the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables. But in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients multiplied by the respective \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that \\(c\\) is a constant, so then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, that's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to clarify the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a function of \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a scalar. So, perhaps the question is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product of two polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that \\(c\\) is a specific value, but it's not given. So, I think the only way to get a scalar coefficient is to evaluate the entire expression at a specific value of \\(c\\). For example, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64 times 6, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the intended answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by expanding both expressions.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem,\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- For \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1c^6\\)\n- For \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- For \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. However, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of those terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the respective terms \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all these coefficients: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1.\n\nCalculating that sum: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply together to form that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would be a polynomial, so unless we evaluate it at a specific value of \\(c\\), we can't get a scalar coefficient.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 64, and then multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nI think I've considered multiple approaches and they all lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThis expansion results in:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is:\n\\[\n1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\).",
