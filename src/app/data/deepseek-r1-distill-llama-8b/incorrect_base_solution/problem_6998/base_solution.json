  "solution": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an x-intercept of a function is a point where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis. That happens when the y-value is zero. So, I need to solve the equation sin(1/x) = 0 for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nAlright, so let me write that down: sin(1/x) = 0. I know that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, substituting \u03b8 with 1/x, I get 1/x = n\u03c0. Therefore, solving for x gives me x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That is, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x with 1/(n\u03c0), the inequality becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me rewrite that: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can invert all parts of this inequality to find the range for n. Remember, when you invert inequalities, the direction of the inequalities reverses if you're dealing with positive numbers, which we are here because x is positive.\n\nSo, inverting each part: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, the inequality becomes 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nTo find the range of n, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically to understand the range for n.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 1000 divided by 3.1416 is roughly 318.31. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.31 < n < 3183.098. But n has to be an integer because it's an integer multiple of \u03c0. Therefore, n can take integer values starting from the next integer greater than 318.31, which is 319, up to the largest integer less than 3183.098, which is 3183.\n\nSo, now I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 is equal to 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from 1/x = n\u03c0, solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), so substituting, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nInverting, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nCalculating the number of integers between 319 and 3183: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, just to double-check, sometimes when counting integers, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. So, let's test with a smaller range. For example, how many integers between 1 and 3 inclusive? It's 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 1, 2, 3. Similarly, between 2 and 4 inclusive: 4 - 2 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 2, 3, 4. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying that same logic, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 is the correct count.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure that when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319\u03c0 is approximately 319*3.1416 \u2248 319*3.1416 \u2248 1001.5. So, 1/1001.5 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less. Wait, but 0.000998 is just under 0.001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.001. So, is x=1/(319\u03c0) inside the interval?\n\nWait, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. But 0.0001 is not included because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, x=0.0001 is not included.\n\nTherefore, do we include n=3183? Let's compute x=1/(3183\u03c0). 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x\u22480.0001, but slightly less. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x=0.0001 is not included, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just slightly above 0.0001? Wait, no, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000.\n\nWait, actually, 3183*\u03c0 is approximately 3183*3.14159265 \u2248 3183*3.1416 \u2248 3183*3 + 3183*0.1416 \u2248 9549 + 452 \u2248 10,001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,001 \u2248 0.000099999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for n is actually 3182. Let me check that. So, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182*3.1416 \u2248 3182*3 + 3182*0.1416 \u2248 9546 + 451 \u2248 10,000 - 1. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999 \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, so let me correct my previous statement. The upper limit for n is 3182, not 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon checking, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the upper n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.00010001, which is inside the interval. So, the correct count is 3182 - 319 +1 =2864.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to be careful with whether the endpoints are included or not.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nWe have x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nInverting, 1000 < n\u03c0 <10,000.\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.31 < n <10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSince n must be integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999 which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 -319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1=2864.\n\nSo, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was off by one. It's 2864, not 2865. So, I need to adjust.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me just verify this with another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the number of solutions to sin(1/x)=0 in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nAs sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, we need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nWhich is the same as 1000 <n\u03c0 <10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 <n <10,000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10,000/\u03c0 - \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number because x must be less than 0.001.\n\nBut 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886, so ceiling(318.309886)=319.\n\n10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so floor(3183.098861 - \u03b5)=3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval, so we need to take floor(10,000/\u03c0 - \u03b5)=3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nHence, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the period of the function sin(1/x). Wait, but the function sin(1/x) isn't periodic in x, because as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, so the function oscillates more and more rapidly.\n\nBut in this case, we're only looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x goes from 10,000 to 1000. So, the function oscillates between sin(1000) and sin(10,000). But in terms of zeros, each period of sin(1/x) will have one zero crossing.\n\nWait, but the period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8=1/x. But since x is changing, the function isn't periodic in x. So, each time \u03b8 increases by 2\u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by a factor of 2\u03c0, the function completes one full oscillation.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating things. Let's think differently.\n\nEach zero crossing occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the zeros are at x=1/(n\u03c0), n=1,2,3,...\n\nSo, the first zero is at x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is outside our interval (0.0001, 0.001). The next zero is at x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, still outside. And so on, until we get down to x=1/(n\u03c0) less than 0.001.\n\nWait, so the zeros are at x=1/(n\u03c0), for n=1,2,3,...\n\nWe need to find n such that 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nSo, as before, 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001 => 1000 <n\u03c0 <10,000 => n between 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.31 and 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.09.\n\nSo, n must be integer from 319 to 3183.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3182 -319.\n\n3182 minus 300 is 2882, then minus 19 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) -ceil(a) +1.\n\nIn this case, a=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886, so ceil(a)=319.\n\nb=10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so floor(b)=3183.\n\nBut as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's not included, so we need to adjust b to 3182.\n\nSo, floor(b - \u03b5)=3182.\n\nThus, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, yeah, 2864 is the correct number.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to solve the equation \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).\n\n1. The function \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta \\) is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n2.

Wait, no, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000.\n\nWait, actually, 3183*\u03c0 is approximately 3183*3.14159265 \u2248 3183*3.1416 \u2248 3183*3 + 3183*0.1416 \u2248 9549 + 452 \u2248 10,001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,001 \u2248 0.000099999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for n is actually 3182. Let me check that. So, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182*3.1416 \u2248 3182*3 + 3182*0.1416 \u2248 9546 + 451 \u2248 10,000 - 1. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999 \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, so let me correct my previous statement. The upper limit for n is 3182, not 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon checking, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the upper n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.00010001, which is inside the interval. So, the correct count is 3182 - 319 +1 =2864.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to be careful with whether the endpoints are included or not.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nWe have x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nInverting, 1000 < n\u03c0 <10,000.\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.31 < n <10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSince n must be integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999 which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 -319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1=2864.\n\nSo, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was off by one. It's 2864, not 2865. So, I need to adjust.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me just verify this with another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the number of solutions to sin(1/x)=0 in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nAs sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, we need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nWhich is the same as 1000 <n\u03c0 <10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 <n <10,000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10,000/\u03c0 - \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number because x must be less than 0.001.\n\nBut 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886, so ceiling(318.309886)=319.\n\n10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so floor(3183.098861 - \u03b5)=3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval, so we need to take floor(10,000/\u03c0 - \u03b5)=3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nHence, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the period of the function sin(1/x). Wait, but the function sin(1/x) isn't periodic in x, because as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, so the function oscillates more and more rapidly.\n\nBut in this case, we're only looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x goes from 10,000 to 1000. So, the function oscillates between sin(1000) and sin(10,000). But in terms of zeros, each period of sin(1/x) will have one zero crossing.\n\nWait, but the period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8=1/x. But since x is changing, the function isn't periodic in x. So, each time \u03b8 increases by 2\u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by a factor of 2\u03c0, the function completes one full oscillation.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating things. Let's think differently.\n\nEach zero crossing occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the zeros are at x=1/(n\u03c0), n=1,2,3,...\n\nSo, the first zero is at x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is outside our interval (0.0001, 0.001). The next zero is at x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, still outside. And so on, until we get down to x=1/(n\u03c0) less than 0.001.\n\nWait, so the zeros are at x=1/(n\u03c0), for n=1,2,3,...\n\nWe need to find n such that 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nSo, as before, 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001 => 1000 <n\u03c0 <10,000 => n between 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.31 and 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.09.\n\nSo, n must be integer from 319 to 3183.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3182 -319.\n\n3182 minus 300 is 2882, then minus 19 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) -ceil(a) +1.\n\nIn this case, a=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886, so ceil(a)=319.\n\nb=10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so floor(b)=3183.\n\nBut as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's not included, so we need to adjust b to 3182.\n\nSo, floor(b - \u03b5)=3182.\n\nThus, number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, yeah, 2864 is the correct number.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to solve the equation \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).\n\n1. The function \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta \\) is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n2. Solving for \\( x \\) gives \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n3. We need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequality:\n   \\[\n   0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001\n   \\]\n4. Inverting the inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   1000 < n\\pi < 10000\n   \\]\n5. Dividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1416), we find:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi}\n   \\]\n   which is approximately:\n   \\[\n   318.31 < n < 3183.098\n   \\]\n6. Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n7. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\).",
