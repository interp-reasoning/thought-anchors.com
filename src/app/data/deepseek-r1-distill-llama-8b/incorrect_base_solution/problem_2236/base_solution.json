The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? Solution: \n<think>\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, I'll analyze the occurrence of each digit in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem by considering the page numbers as three-digit numbers, adding leading zeros where necessary to make them all three digits (e.g., 1 becomes 001, 10 becomes 010, etc.). This will simplify counting the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place:\n\n1. **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\), so 48 full cycles where 4 appears once. Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from 481 to 488, 4 appears once (484). This gives a total of 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears every 100 numbers in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 480-489). There are \\( \\frac{488}{100} = 4.88 \\), so 4 full cycles where 4 appears 10 times each. Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from 480 to 488, 4 appears 9 more times. This gives a total of 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears only in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, the digit 4 appears 49 + 49 + 89 = 187 times.\n\nNow, I'll perform the same analysis for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\), so 48 full cycles where 8 appears once. Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from 481 to 488, 8 appears once (488). This gives a total of 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears every 100 numbers in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 880-889). However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last full cycle is 380-389. There are \\( \\frac{488}{100} = 4.88 \\), so 4 full cycles where 8 appears 10 times each. This gives 40 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nAdding these together, the digit 8 appears 49 + 40 = 89 times.\n\nFinally, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 - 89 = 98.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more **4's** are printed than **8's** in the page numbers of a **488-page** book, we'll analyze the occurrence of each digit in the page numbers from **1** to **488**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Range:**\n   - The book has **488 pages**, so we'll consider page numbers from **1** to **488**.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Digit Place:**\n   - We'll examine the **units place**, **tens place**, and **hundreds place** separately.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 4's:**\n\n   - **Units Place (4 in the ones position):**\n     - The digit **4** appears every **10** numbers: **4, 14, 24, ..., 484**.\n     - Number of cycles: \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\), so **48** full cycles.\n     - In each cycle, **4** appears once.\n     - Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from **481** to **488**, **4** appears once (**484**).\n     - **Total 4's in units place:** \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n   - **Tens Place (4 in the tens position):**\n     - The digit **4** appears every **100** numbers in the tens place: **40-49, 140-149, ..., 480-489**.\n     - Number of cycles: \\( \\frac{488}{100} = 4.88 \\), so **4** full cycles.\n     - In each cycle, **4** appears **10** times.\n     - Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from **480** to **488**, **4** appears **9** more times (since the tens digit cycles from **8** to **9**).\n     - **Total 4's in tens place:** \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (4 in the hundreds position):**\n     - The digit **4** appears only in the hundreds place from **400** to **488**.\n     - Number of pages: \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n     - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** \\(89\\).\n\n   - **Total 4's:** \\(49 + 49 + 89 = 187\\).\n\n4. **Count the Number of 8's:**\n\n   - **Units Place (8 in the ones position):**\n     - The digit **8** appears every **10** numbers: **8, 18, 28, ..., 488**.\n     - Number of cycles: \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\), so **48** full cycles.\n     - In each cycle, **8** appears once.\n     - Additionally, in the incomplete cycle from **481** to **488**, **8** appears once (**488**).\n     - **Total 8's in units place:** \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n   - **Tens Place (8 in the tens position):**\n     - The digit **8** appears every **100** numbers in the tens place: **80-89, 180-189, ..., 880-889**.\n     - However, since the book only goes up to **488**, the last full cycle is **380-389**.\n     - Number of cycles: \\( \\frac{488}{100} = 4.88 \\), so **4** full cycles.\n     - In each cycle, **8** appears **10** times.\n     - **Total 8's in tens place:** \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (8 in the hundreds position):**\n     - The digit **8** does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to **488**.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** \\(49 + 40 = 89\\).\n\n5. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 187\n   - **Total 8's:** 89\n   - **Difference:** \\(187 - 89 = 98\\)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}\n\\]",
