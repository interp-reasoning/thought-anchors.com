  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out how many base-2 digits, or bits, the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has when it's written in binary. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that base-16 is hexadecimal, which is a common numbering system used in computing. Each digit in a hexadecimal number corresponds to 4 bits in binary because \\(2^4 = 16\\). So, if I can figure out how many digits are in the hexadecimal number, I can multiply that by 4 to get the number of bits.\n\nThe given number is \\(66666_{16}\\). Let me count the number of digits. Starting from the left, each digit is a 6, and there are five of them. So, that's 5 digits in hexadecimal. If each digit is 4 bits, then the total number of bits should be \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) bits. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, maybe I should convert the hexadecimal number to decimal first and then convert that decimal number to binary to see how many bits it actually has. That might be a more accurate way to confirm the number of bits.\n\nStarting with \\(66666_{16}\\), let me convert it to decimal. In hexadecimal, each digit represents a power of 16. The rightmost digit is \\(16^0\\), then \\(16^1\\), \\(16^2\\), and so on. So, let's break it down:\n\n- The leftmost digit is 6, which is in the \\(16^4\\) place.\n- The next digit is also 6, in the \\(16^3\\) place.\n- The third digit is 6 in the \\(16^2\\) place.\n- The fourth digit is 6 in the \\(16^1\\) place.\n- The rightmost digit is 6 in the \\(16^0\\) place.\n\nSo, converting each digit:\n\n- \\(6 \\times 16^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 16^3\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 16^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 16^1\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 16^0\\)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. \\(16^4 = 65536\\), so \\(6 \\times 65536 = 393216\\)\n2. \\(16^3 = 4096\\), so \\(6 \\times 4096 = 24576\\)\n3. \\(16^2 = 256\\), so \\(6 \\times 256 = 1536\\)\n4. \\(16^1 = 16\\), so \\(6 \\times 16 = 96\\)\n5. \\(16^0 = 1\\), so \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n393,216 + 24,576 = 417,792\n\n417,792 + 1,536 = 419,328\n\n419,328 + 96 = 419,424\n\n419,424 + 6 = 419,430\n\nSo, \\(66666_{16}\\) in decimal is 419,430.\n\nNow, let me convert this decimal number to binary. To do that, I can use the division by 2 method repeatedly and count the number of divisions until the quotient is zero. Alternatively, I can use a more efficient method by determining the highest power of 2 less than or equal to the number.\n\nLet me find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419,430. I know that \\(2^{18} = 262,144\\) and \\(2^{19} = 524,288\\). Since 524,288 is larger than 419,430, the highest power needed is \\(2^{18}\\).\n\nSo, starting with \\(2^{18}\\):\n\n419,430 \u00f7 262,144 = 1 with a remainder of 419,430 - 262,144 = 157,286\n\n157,286 \u00f7 131,072 (which is \\(2^{17}\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 157,286 - 131,072 = 26,214\n\n26,214 \u00f7 65,536 (which is \\(2^{16}\\)) = 0, so we move to the next lower power.\n\n26,214 \u00f7 32,768 (which is \\(2^{15}\\)) = 0\n\n26,214 \u00f7 16,384 (which is \\(2^{14}\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 26,214 - 16,384 = 9,830\n\n9,830 \u00f7 8,192 (which is \\(2^{13}\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 9,830 - 8,192 = 1,638\n\n1,638 \u00f7 4,096 (which is \\(2^{12}\\)) = 0\n\n1,638 \u00f7 2,048 (which is \\(2^{11}\\)) = 0\n\n1,638 \u00f7 1,024 (which is \\(2^{10}\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 1,638 - 1,024 = 614\n\n614 \u00f7 512 (which is \\(2^9\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 614 - 512 = 102\n\n102 \u00f7 256 (which is \\(2^8\\)) = 0\n\n102 \u00f7 128 (which is \\(2^7\\)) = 0\n\n102 \u00f7 64 (which is \\(2^6\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 102 - 64 = 38\n\n38 \u00f7 32 (which is \\(2^5\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 38 - 32 = 6\n\n6 \u00f7 16 (which is \\(2^4\\)) = 0\n\n6 \u00f7 8 (which is \\(2^3\\)) = 0\n\n6 \u00f7 4 (which is \\(2^2\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 6 - 4 = 2\n\n2 \u00f7 2 (which is \\(2^1\\)) = 1 with a remainder of 0\n\nSo, writing down the binary digits from highest power to lowest:\n\n1 (for \\(2^{18}\\)), 1 (for \\(2^{17}\\)), 0 (for \\(2^{16}\\)), 1 (for \\(2^{14}\\)), 1 (for \\(2^{13}\\)), 0 (for \\(2^{12}\\)), 0 (for \\(2^{11}\\)), 1 (for \\(2^{10}\\)), 1 (for \\(2^9\\)), 0 (for \\(2^8\\)), 0 (for \\(2^7\\)), 1 (for \\(2^6\\)), 1 (for \\(2^5\\)), 0 (for \\(2^4\\)), 0 (for \\(2^3\\)), 1 (for \\(2^2\\)), 1 (for \\(2^1\\)), and 0 (for \\(2^0\\)).\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me count the number of bits:\n\n1. \\(2^{18}\\) - 1\n2. \\(2^{17}\\) - 2\n3. \\(2^{16}\\) - 3\n4. \\(2^{14}\\) - 4\n5. \\(2^{13}\\) - 5\n6. \\(2^{12}\\) - 6\n7. \\(2^{11}\\) - 7\n8. \\(2^{10}\\) - 8\n9. \\(2^9\\) - 9\n10. \\(2^8\\) - 10\n11. \\(2^7\\) - 11\n12. \\(2^6\\) - 12\n13. \\(2^5\\) - 13\n14. \\(2^4\\) - 14\n15. \\(2^3\\) - 15\n16. \\(2^2\\) - 16\n17. \\(2^1\\) - 17\n18. \\(2^0\\) - 18\n\nSo, that's 18 bits. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it would be 20 bits. Hmm, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the bits. Let me list out the binary digits step by step:\n\nStarting from the highest power:\n\n1. \\(2^{18}\\): 1\n2. \\(2^{17}\\): 1\n3. \\(2^{16}\\): 0\n4. \\(2^{14}\\): 1\n5. \\(2^{13}\\): 1\n6. \\(2^{12}\\): 0\n7. \\(2^{11}\\): 0\n8. \\(2^{10}\\): 1\n9. \\(2^9\\): 1\n10. \\(2^8\\): 0\n11. \\(2^7\\): 0\n12. \\(2^6\\): 1\n13. \\(2^5\\): 1\n14. \\(2^4\\): 0\n15. \\(2^3\\): 0\n16. \\(2^2\\): 1\n17. \\(2^1\\): 1\n18. \\(2^0\\): 0\n\nSo, writing them out: 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nCounting these: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So, 18 bits in total.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 5 hex digits would translate to 20 bits. So, which is it?\n\nLet me think again. Each hex digit is 4 bits, so 5 hex digits should be 5 * 4 = 20 bits. But when I converted the number to decimal and then to binary, I only got 18 bits. That means there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, maybe my conversion to binary was incorrect. Let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 419,430:\n\n1. 419,430 \u00f7 262,144 (2^18) = 1, remainder 157,286\n2. 157,286 \u00f7 131,072 (2^17) = 1, remainder 26,214\n3. 26,214 \u00f7 65,536 (2^16) = 0, remainder 26,214\n4. 26,214 \u00f7 32,768 (2^15) = 0, remainder 26,214\n5. 26,214 \u00f7 16,384 (2^14) = 1, remainder 9,830\n6. 9,830 \u00f7 8,192 (2^13) = 1, remainder 1,638\n7. 1,638 \u00f7 4,096 (2^12) = 0, remainder 1,638\n8. 1,638 \u00f7 2,048 (2^11) = 0, remainder 1,638\n9. 1,638 \u00f7 1,024 (2^10) = 1, remainder 614\n10. 614 \u00f7 512 (2^9) = 1, remainder 102\n11. 102 \u00f7 256 (2^8) = 0, remainder 102\n12. 102 \u00f7 128 (2^7) = 0, remainder 102\n13. 102 \u00f7 64 (2^6) = 1, remainder 38\n14. 38 \u00f7 32 (2^5) = 1, remainder 6\n15. 6 \u00f7 16 (2^4) = 0, remainder 6\n16. 6 \u00f7 8 (2^3) = 0, remainder 6\n17. 6 \u00f7 4 (2^2) = 1, remainder 2\n18. 2 \u00f7 2 (2^1) = 1, remainder 0\n\nSo, the binary representation is: 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nWhich is 18 bits. So, why is this conflicting with the earlier idea that 5 hex digits correspond to 20 bits?\n\nWait a second, maybe leading zeros are being omitted. When I converted the decimal number to binary, I didn't consider leading zeros, but in reality, when converting from hex to binary, each hex digit is exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits should be 20 bits.\n\nPerhaps when I converted 419,430 to binary, I only got 18 bits because the number doesn't require all 20 bits. But actually, when we convert each hex digit to 4 bits, we have to include all 20 bits, even if the leading bits are zeros.\n\nSo, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion process. Let me try another method.\n\nAlternatively, instead of converting to decimal first, I can convert each hex digit to 4 bits and concatenate them.\n\nGiven \\(66666_{16}\\):\n\nEach '6' in hex is 0110 in binary (since 6 in decimal is 0110 in 4 bits). So, writing each digit:\n\nFirst digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nSecond digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nThird digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nFourth digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nFifth digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nSo, concatenating all these together:\n\n0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nCounting the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\n\nSo, that's 20 bits in total. Therefore, the correct number of bits is 20.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I converted to decimal and then to binary, I only got 18 bits. That must mean that the leading zeros are not being represented when converting from decimal to binary. So, when we convert the entire hex number to binary, we have to include all 20 bits, including the leading zeros.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of bits is 20.\n\nI think my initial confusion was because when I converted the decimal number to binary, the leading zeros were omitted, which led me to think it was only 18 bits. However, when converting hex to binary directly, each hex digit is exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits translate to 20 bits, regardless of whether the decimal equivalent requires fewer bits.\n\nSo, to confirm, \\(66666_{16}\\) in binary is 20 bits long. Therefore, the answer is 20 bits.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe base-2 number has \\boxed{20} bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many base-2 digits (bits) the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has when written in binary, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the hexadecimal number to binary**:\n   - Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits in binary.\n   - The number \\(66666_{16}\\) has 5 digits in hexadecimal.\n   - Therefore, each digit is converted to 4 bits, resulting in \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) bits.\n\n2. **Verification by conversion to decimal and then to binary**:\n   - Convert \\(66666_{16}\\) to decimal:\n     - \\(6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\\)\n     - This results in 419,430 in decimal.\n   - Convert 419,430 to binary:\n     - The binary representation is 11011001100110, which is 18 bits long.\n   - However, this conversion omits leading zeros. Converting each hexadecimal digit directly to 4 bits results in 20 bits.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Converting each hexadecimal digit to 4 bits ensures that all leading zeros are included, resulting in 20 bits.\n\nThus, the base-2 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) bits.",

Let me double-check that.\n\nStarting with 419,430:\n\n1. 419,430 \u00f7 262,144 (2^18) = 1, remainder 157,286\n2. 157,286 \u00f7 131,072 (2^17) = 1, remainder 26,214\n3. 26,214 \u00f7 65,536 (2^16) = 0, remainder 26,214\n4. 26,214 \u00f7 32,768 (2^15) = 0, remainder 26,214\n5. 26,214 \u00f7 16,384 (2^14) = 1, remainder 9,830\n6. 9,830 \u00f7 8,192 (2^13) = 1, remainder 1,638\n7. 1,638 \u00f7 4,096 (2^12) = 0, remainder 1,638\n8. 1,638 \u00f7 2,048 (2^11) = 0, remainder 1,638\n9. 1,638 \u00f7 1,024 (2^10) = 1, remainder 614\n10. 614 \u00f7 512 (2^9) = 1, remainder 102\n11. 102 \u00f7 256 (2^8) = 0, remainder 102\n12. 102 \u00f7 128 (2^7) = 0, remainder 102\n13. 102 \u00f7 64 (2^6) = 1, remainder 38\n14. 38 \u00f7 32 (2^5) = 1, remainder 6\n15. 6 \u00f7 16 (2^4) = 0, remainder 6\n16. 6 \u00f7 8 (2^3) = 0, remainder 6\n17. 6 \u00f7 4 (2^2) = 1, remainder 2\n18. 2 \u00f7 2 (2^1) = 1, remainder 0\n\nSo, the binary representation is: 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nWhich is 18 bits. So, why is this conflicting with the earlier idea that 5 hex digits correspond to 20 bits?\n\nWait a second, maybe leading zeros are being omitted. When I converted the decimal number to binary, I didn't consider leading zeros, but in reality, when converting from hex to binary, each hex digit is exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits should be 20 bits.\n\nPerhaps when I converted 419,430 to binary, I only got 18 bits because the number doesn't require all 20 bits. But actually, when we convert each hex digit to 4 bits, we have to include all 20 bits, even if the leading bits are zeros.\n\nSo, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion process. Let me try another method.\n\nAlternatively, instead of converting to decimal first, I can convert each hex digit to 4 bits and concatenate them.\n\nGiven \\(66666_{16}\\):\n\nEach '6' in hex is 0110 in binary (since 6 in decimal is 0110 in 4 bits). So, writing each digit:\n\nFirst digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nSecond digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nThird digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nFourth digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nFifth digit: 6 -> 0110\n\nSo, concatenating all these together:\n\n0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nCounting the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\n\nSo, that's 20 bits in total. Therefore, the correct number of bits is 20.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I converted to decimal and then to binary, I only got 18 bits. That must mean that the leading zeros are not being represented when converting from decimal to binary. So, when we convert the entire hex number to binary, we have to include all 20 bits, including the leading zeros.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of bits is 20.\n\nI think my initial confusion was because when I converted the decimal number to binary, the leading zeros were omitted, which led me to think it was only 18 bits. However, when converting hex to binary directly, each hex digit is exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits translate to 20 bits, regardless of whether the decimal equivalent requires fewer bits.\n\nSo, to confirm, \\(66666_{16}\\) in binary is 20 bits long. Therefore, the answer is 20 bits.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe base-2 number has \\boxed{20} bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many base-2 digits (bits) the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has when written in binary, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the hexadecimal number to binary**:\n   - Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits in binary.\n   - The number \\(66666_{16}\\) has 5 digits in hexadecimal.\n   - Therefore, each digit is converted to 4 bits, resulting in \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) bits.\n\n2. **Verification by conversion to decimal and then to binary**:\n   - Convert \\(66666_{16}\\) to decimal:\n     - \\(6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0\\)\n     - This results in 419,430 in decimal.\n   - Convert 419,430 to binary:\n     - The binary representation is 11011001100110, which is 18 bits long.\n   - However, this conversion omits leading zeros. Converting each hexadecimal digit directly to 4 bits results in 20 bits.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Converting each hexadecimal digit to 4 bits ensures that all leading zeros are included, resulting in 20 bits.\n\nThus, the base-2 number \\(66666_{16}\\) has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) bits.",
