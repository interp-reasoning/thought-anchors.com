  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out how many bits the base-16 number 66666\u2081\u2086 has when it's converted to base-2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits, or bits. So, maybe I can just figure out how many hexadecimal digits there are and multiply by 4 to get the number of bits. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, the number given is 66666 in base 16. Let me count the digits: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. That's five digits in total. So, if each digit is 4 bits, then 5 digits would be 5 * 4 = 20 bits. Wait, is that always the case? I think so because each hex digit maps directly to 4 bits without any overlap or sharing. So, 66666\u2081\u2086 would be 20 bits in binary. But wait, I should make sure that this is correct by actually converting the number or at least checking if there's any leading zero that might affect the bit count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the value of 66666\u2081\u2086 in decimal and then find out how many bits that number would require. Let's try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nSo, to convert 66666\u2081\u2086 to decimal, I can expand it as follows:\n\nEach digit represents a power of 16. Starting from the right, the digits are 16\u2070, 16\u00b9, 16\u00b2, 16\u00b3, 16\u2074.\n\nSo, the number is:\n\n6 * 16\u2074 + 6 * 16\u00b3 + 6 * 16\u00b2 + 6 * 16\u00b9 + 6 * 16\u2070\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, 16\u2074 is 16 * 16 * 16 * 16. 16\u00b2 is 256, so 16\u00b3 is 256 * 16 = 4096, and 16\u2074 is 4096 * 16 = 65536.\n\nSo, 6 * 65536 = 393216\n\nNext, 16\u00b3 is 4096, so 6 * 4096 = 24576\n\nThen, 16\u00b2 is 256, so 6 * 256 = 1536\n\n16\u00b9 is 16, so 6 * 16 = 96\n\nAnd 16\u2070 is 1, so 6 * 1 = 6\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\n393216 + 24576 = 417,792\n\n417,792 + 1536 = 419,328\n\n419,328 + 96 = 419,424\n\n419,424 + 6 = 419,430\n\nSo, 66666\u2081\u2086 is equal to 419,430 in decimal.\n\nNow, to find out how many bits this number requires, I can use the formula for the number of bits needed to represent a number N in binary, which is floor(log\u2082(N)) + 1.\n\nSo, let's compute log\u2082(419,430). Hmm, I don't have a calculator here, but I can estimate it.\n\nI know that 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144\n\n2\u00b9\u2079 = 524,288\n\nSo, 419,430 is between 2\u00b9\u2078 and 2\u00b9\u2079.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(419,430) is between 18 and 19.\n\nThe floor of that would be 18, so the number of bits is 18 + 1 = 19 bits.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it would be 20 bits because it's 5 hex digits each being 4 bits. Now, according to this, it's 19 bits. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up the decimal conversion.\n\nWait, 66666 in hex. Let me convert it step by step again.\n\n6 * 16\u2074: 6 * 65536 = 393216\n\n6 * 16\u00b3: 6 * 4096 = 24576\n\n6 * 16\u00b2: 6 * 256 = 1536\n\n6 * 16\u00b9: 6 * 16 = 96\n\n6 * 16\u2070: 6 * 1 = 6\n\nAdding them up: 393216 + 24576 = 417,792\n\n417,792 + 1536 = 419,328\n\n419,328 + 96 = 419,424\n\n419,424 + 6 = 419,430. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 419,430 in decimal. Now, let's check 2\u00b9\u2078 is 262,144, 2\u00b9\u2079 is 524,288. So, 419,430 is less than 524,288, so log\u2082(419,430) is less than 19. So, floor(log\u2082(419,430)) is 18, so number of bits is 19.\n\nBut wait, when I thought about each hex digit being 4 bits, 5 hex digits would be 20 bits. So, why is there a difference?\n\nAh, perhaps because leading zeros are not counted. So, when converting from hex to binary, each digit is 4 bits, but if the leading hex digits are such that when converted to binary, they don't add any leading zeros beyond the 4 bits per digit. Wait, but 66666 in hex is 5 digits, so 5 * 4 = 20 bits. But according to the decimal conversion, it's 19 bits. That suggests that when converted to binary, it's 19 bits, not 20. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps when converting 66666\u2081\u2086 to binary, it's exactly 20 bits, but the leading bits are zeros, so when counting the number of bits, we don't count leading zeros. Wait, but in the problem, it's just asking how many bits it has when written in base 2. So, does that include leading zeros or not?\n\nWait, no, when you write a number in binary, you don't include leading zeros beyond the most significant bit. So, if the number in binary starts with a 1, then the number of bits is the position of the highest set bit plus one.\n\nSo, in this case, 419,430 in decimal is less than 2\u00b9\u2079 (524,288) but more than 2\u00b9\u2078 (262,144). So, it's between 18 and 19 bits. Wait, but 2\u00b9\u2078 is 262,144, and 2\u00b9\u2079 is 524,288. So, 419,430 is greater than 2\u00b9\u2078, so the highest bit set is at position 18 (counting from 0). Therefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nBut wait, when converting 66666\u2081\u2086 to binary, each hex digit is 4 bits, so 5 hex digits would give 20 bits. But according to the decimal value, it's 19 bits. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the leading hex digit, which is 6, when converted to binary is 0110, so the first four bits are 0110. So, the first bit is 0, which is a leading zero. So, when we write the binary number, we don't include leading zeros, so the first 0 would be dropped, but wait, that's not correct because each hex digit is four bits, so the leading zeros are part of the binary representation of that hex digit. But when writing the entire number, leading zeros can be dropped, but in this case, since the first hex digit is 6, which is 0110 in binary, the leading zero is part of the first four bits, but when considering the entire number, the leading zero is not part of the significant bits. So, perhaps the binary number starts with 0110 for the first hex digit, but the leading zero would be dropped, so the total number of bits would be 20 - 1 = 19 bits.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when converting each hex digit to 4 bits, the first hex digit is 6, which is 0110, so the first bit is 0, which is a leading zero. So, when writing the entire binary number, we can drop that leading zero, so the total number of bits becomes 19 instead of 20.\n\nSo, that's why the number of bits is 19, not 20.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought each hex digit maps to exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits would always be 20 bits. But in reality, when the leading hex digit's binary representation starts with a zero, that leading zero can be dropped when writing the binary number, reducing the total number of bits by one.\n\nSo, in this case, since the first hex digit is 6, which is 0110, the leading zero can be dropped, making the binary number start with 110, and then the rest of the bits follow. Therefore, the total number of bits is 20 - 1 = 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually converting 66666\u2081\u2086 to binary and counting the bits.\n\nSo, let's convert each hex digit to 4 bits:\n\n6 in hex is 0110\n\n6 is 0110\n\n6 is 0110\n\n6 is 0110\n\n6 is 0110\n\nSo, putting them together, we get:\n\n0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nNow, writing that out without spaces: 01100110011001100110\n\nNow, let's count the bits: 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nThat's 20 bits. But the first bit is 0, so if we drop that leading zero, we get 1100110011001100110, which is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but does the problem consider leading zeros when writing the number in binary? I think not. Because when you write a number in binary, you don't include leading zeros beyond the most significant bit. So, the correct number of bits is 19.\n\nBut then, why did I initially think it would be 20 bits? Because I was considering each hex digit as 4 bits without considering that the leading zero can be dropped. So, the correct answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me check again by converting the number to binary and seeing how many bits it actually has.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula: number of bits = floor(log\u2082(N)) + 1\n\nWe found that N = 419,430\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is approximately:\n\nWe know that 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144\n\n2\u00b9\u2079 = 524,288\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is between 18 and 19.\n\nTo get a better approximation, let's compute 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144\n\n2\u00b9\u2078.5 = 2^(18 + 0.5) = 2\u00b9\u2078 * sqrt(2) \u2248 262,144 * 1.4142 \u2248 371,589\n\n2\u00b9\u2078.7 \u2248 2\u00b9\u2078 * 2^0.7 \u2248 262,144 * 1.6245 \u2248 425,500\n\nWait, 2\u00b9\u2078.7 is approximately 425,500, which is more than 419,430.\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is approximately 18.7, so floor(log\u2082(N)) = 18, so number of bits is 18 + 1 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 20 bits because each hex digit is 4 bits, but since the first hex digit starts with a zero, which can be dropped, the total number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by actually writing out the binary number.\n\nSo, converting each hex digit to 4 bits:\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\nSo, concatenating them: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nThat's 20 bits: 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nBut if we drop the leading zero, it becomes 19 bits: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nWait, but that's not correct because dropping the leading zero would mean the first bit is 1, but the rest follow. Let me count the bits after dropping the leading zero:\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nThat's 19 bits. So, the binary number is 19 bits long.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19 bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of bits when the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) is converted to base-2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert each hexadecimal digit to 4 binary digits:**\n   - Each digit in \\(66666_{16}\\) is '6', which converts to '0110' in binary.\n   - Therefore, \\(66666_{16}\\) becomes '0110 0110 0110 0110 0110' in binary.\n\n2. **Concatenate the binary digits:**\n   - The concatenated binary string is '01100110011001100110', which is 20 bits long.\n\n3. **Remove leading zeros:**\n   - The leading zero can be dropped, resulting in '1100110011001100110', which is 19 bits long.\n\n4. **Alternative verification using decimal conversion:**\n   - Convert \\(66666_{16}\\) to decimal:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0 = 419430_{10}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the number of bits using the formula \\(\\text{floor}(\\log_2(N)) + 1\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{floor}(\\log_2(419430)) + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 \\text{ bits}\n     \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the binary representation of \\(66666_{16}\\) has 19 bits.\n\n\\boxed{19}",

Problem: When the base-16 number $66666_{16}$ is written in base 2, how many base-2 digits (bits) does it have?

Now, according to this, it's 19 bits. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up the decimal conversion.\n\nWait, 66666 in hex. Let me convert it step by step again.\n\n6 * 16\u2074: 6 * 65536 = 393216\n\n6 * 16\u00b3: 6 * 4096 = 24576\n\n6 * 16\u00b2: 6 * 256 = 1536\n\n6 * 16\u00b9: 6 * 16 = 96\n\n6 * 16\u2070: 6 * 1 = 6\n\nAdding them up: 393216 + 24576 = 417,792\n\n417,792 + 1536 = 419,328\n\n419,328 + 96 = 419,424\n\n419,424 + 6 = 419,430.

So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps when converting 66666\u2081\u2086 to binary, it's exactly 20 bits, but the leading bits are zeros, so when counting the number of bits, we don't count leading zeros. Wait, but in the problem, it's just asking how many bits it has when written in base 2. So, does that include leading zeros or not?\n\nWait, no, when you write a number in binary, you don't include leading zeros beyond the most significant bit. So, if the number in binary starts with a 1, then the number of bits is the position of the highest set bit plus one.\n\nSo, in this case, 419,430 in decimal is less than 2\u00b9\u2079 (524,288) but more than 2\u00b9\u2078 (262,144). So, it's between 18 and 19 bits. Wait, but 2\u00b9\u2078 is 262,144, and 2\u00b9\u2079 is 524,288. So, 419,430 is greater than 2\u00b9\u2078, so the highest bit set is at position 18 (counting from 0). Therefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nBut wait, when converting 66666\u2081\u2086 to binary, each hex digit is 4 bits, so 5 hex digits would give 20 bits. But according to the decimal value, it's 19 bits. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the leading hex digit, which is 6, when converted to binary is 0110, so the first four bits are 0110. So, the first bit is 0, which is a leading zero. So, when we write the binary number, we don't include leading zeros, so the first 0 would be dropped, but wait, that's not correct because each hex digit is four bits, so the leading zeros are part of the binary representation of that hex digit. But when writing the entire number, leading zeros can be dropped, but in this case, since the first hex digit is 6, which is 0110 in binary, the leading zero is part of the first four bits, but when considering the entire number, the leading zero is not part of the significant bits. So, perhaps the binary number starts with 0110 for the first hex digit, but the leading zero would be dropped, so the total number of bits would be 20 - 1 = 19 bits.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when converting each hex digit to 4 bits, the first hex digit is 6, which is 0110, so the first bit is 0, which is a leading zero. So, when writing the entire binary number, we can drop that leading zero, so the total number of bits becomes 19 instead of 20.\n\nSo, that's why the number of bits is 19, not 20.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought each hex digit maps to exactly 4 bits, so 5 hex digits would always be 20 bits.

But the first bit is 0, so if we drop that leading zero, we get 1100110011001100110, which is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but does the problem consider leading zeros when writing the number in binary? I think not. Because when you write a number in binary, you don't include leading zeros beyond the most significant bit. So, the correct number of bits is 19.\n\nBut then, why did I initially think it would be 20 bits? Because I was considering each hex digit as 4 bits without considering that the leading zero can be dropped. So, the correct answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me check again by converting the number to binary and seeing how many bits it actually has.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula: number of bits = floor(log\u2082(N)) + 1\n\nWe found that N = 419,430\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is approximately:\n\nWe know that 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144\n\n2\u00b9\u2079 = 524,288\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is between 18 and 19.\n\nTo get a better approximation, let's compute 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144\n\n2\u00b9\u2078.5 = 2^(18 + 0.5) = 2\u00b9\u2078 * sqrt(2) \u2248 262,144 * 1.4142 \u2248 371,589\n\n2\u00b9\u2078.7 \u2248 2\u00b9\u2078 * 2^0.7 \u2248 262,144 * 1.6245 \u2248 425,500\n\nWait, 2\u00b9\u2078.7 is approximately 425,500, which is more than 419,430.\n\nSo, log\u2082(419,430) is approximately 18.7, so floor(log\u2082(N)) = 18, so number of bits is 18 + 1 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 20 bits because each hex digit is 4 bits, but since the first hex digit starts with a zero, which can be dropped, the total number of bits is 19.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 19 bits.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by actually writing out the binary number.\n\nSo, converting each hex digit to 4 bits:\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\n6 = 0110\n\nSo, concatenating them: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110\n\nThat's 20 bits: 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nBut if we drop the leading zero, it becomes 19 bits: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nWait, but that's not correct because dropping the leading zero would mean the first bit is 1, but the rest follow. Let me count the bits after dropping the leading zero:\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nThat's 19 bits. So, the binary number is 19 bits long.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19 bits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of bits when the base-16 number \\(66666_{16}\\) is converted to base-2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert each hexadecimal digit to 4 binary digits:**\n   - Each digit in \\(66666_{16}\\) is '6', which converts to '0110' in binary.\n   - Therefore, \\(66666_{16}\\) becomes '0110 0110 0110 0110 0110' in binary.\n\n2. **Concatenate the binary digits:**\n   - The concatenated binary string is '01100110011001100110', which is 20 bits long.\n\n3. **Remove leading zeros:**\n   - The leading zero can be dropped, resulting in '1100110011001100110', which is 19 bits long.\n\n4. **Alternative verification using decimal conversion:**\n   - Convert \\(66666_{16}\\) to decimal:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 16^4 + 6 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 6 \\times 16^1 + 6 \\times 16^0 = 419430_{10}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the number of bits using the formula \\(\\text{floor}(\\log_2(N)) + 1\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{floor}(\\log_2(419430)) + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 \\text{ bits}\n     \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the binary representation of \\(66666_{16}\\) has 19 bits.\n\n\\boxed{19}",
