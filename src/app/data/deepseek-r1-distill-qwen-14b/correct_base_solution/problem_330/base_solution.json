  "solution": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It seems like there's a repeating pattern here, which might mean that I can solve it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That makes sense because each opening parenthesis must be closed eventually, so starting from the inside would be logical.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI count nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds another 3 times some expression. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part.\n\nLet's start by labeling each layer for clarity. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one.\n\nWait, actually, the expression starts with 3 times something. So, maybe the innermost part is just 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final step would be:\n\nFinal Answer: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, actually, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nCompute 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B\n\nRHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the closed-form expression to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing step by step is feasible.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\).",
