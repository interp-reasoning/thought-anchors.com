  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, x-intercepts are where the function crosses the x-axis, which means y = 0. So, I need to find how many times sin(1/x) equals zero in that interval.\n\nLet me start by recalling that sin(\u03b8) is zero when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is any integer. Applying that to the function here, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x is positive and between 0.0001 and 0.001, I can substitute x with 1/(n\u03c0) to find the range of n.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), the inequalities become:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's take the first inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, the inequality direction remains the same):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\nn > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. But n has to be an integer, so n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309 to the largest integer less than 3183.098.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes when counting integers between two numbers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me think: if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, how many terms are there?\n\nThe formula is (last - first) + 1. So, (3183 - 319) + 1 = (2864) + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the initial inequalities to make sure I didn't flip anything. So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) being in that interval. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSolving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, which as integers is n from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I subtract 3183 - 319, that's 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me take a smaller example to see if the formula works. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. Using the formula: (5 - 2) +1 = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n from 1 to 3. Numbers:1,2,3. Count is 3. Formula: (3 -1) +1 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a unique x, and since n is an integer, each x is distinct and lies within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, right? Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. Wait, does that affect our count?\n\nWait, hold on, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, when n approaches 3183, x approaches 0.0001 from above, and when n approaches 319, x approaches 0.001 from below.\n\nWait, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 (since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001. But since the interval is open, we don't include x = 0.0001. So, does n = 3183 give x = 0.0001 exactly? Let's check:\n\nn = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x = 0.0001000028 lie within the interval? Yes, because 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001. So, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x just below 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nWait, but hold on, when n increases, x decreases, right? Because x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x gets smaller. So, n=319 gives the largest x in the interval, which is just below 0.001, and n=3183 gives the smallest x in the interval, just above 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x values within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001, but wait, earlier calculation showed it's approximately 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.424777\n\nSo, 565.48667 + 9.424777 \u2248 574.91145\n\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91145 \u2248 9999.68941\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just a bit over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, x \u2248 0.0001000031, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796\n\n19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604\n\nSo total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the subtraction. 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is equal to (3183 - 319) +1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x is positive and between 0.0001 and 0.001, I can substitute x with 1/(n\u03c0) to find the range of n.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), the inequalities become:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n.

Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.424777\n\nSo, 565.48667 + 9.424777 \u2248 574.91145\n\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91145 \u2248 9999.68941\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just a bit over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, x \u2248 0.0001000031, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796\n\n19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604\n\nSo total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the subtraction. 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is equal to (3183 - 319) +1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). Solving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) leads to \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\).\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) leads to \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\).",
