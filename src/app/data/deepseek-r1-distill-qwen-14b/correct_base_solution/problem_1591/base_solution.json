  "solution": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about bank accounts and interest rates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says Dr. Fu Manchu has a bank account with an annual interest rate of 6 percent, but it compounds monthly. They want to find the equivalent annual interest rate, r percent, if it were compounded annually instead. And I need to give the answer to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, okay.\n\nI remember that compound interest formulas can be a bit tricky, but let me recall the basic concepts. When interest is compounded more frequently, like monthly instead of annually, the effective annual rate is higher. So, even though the stated rate is 6%, because it's compounding monthly, the actual interest earned in a year would be a bit more than 6%. That makes sense because you're earning interest on the interest each month.\n\nLet me write down the formulas I remember. The formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, we're dealing with one year, so t = 1. The rate is 6%, which as a decimal is 0.06. It's compounded monthly, so n = 12.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, the amount after one year would be:\n\nA = P(1 + 0.06/12)^(12*1)\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\nA = P(1 + 0.005)^12\n\nBecause 0.06 divided by 12 is 0.005. Now, 1 + 0.005 is 1.005. So, A = P*(1.005)^12.\n\nNow, I need to calculate (1.005)^12. Let me think about how to do that. I could use logarithms, but maybe it's easier to just compute it step by step or use the rule of 72 or something, but I think I should just calculate it accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that (1 + r/n)^(nt) can be approximated using the formula for effective annual rate, which is:\n\nEffective Annual Rate (EAR) = (1 + nominal rate / n)^n - 1\n\nSo, in this case, EAR = (1 + 0.06/12)^12 - 1. That would give me the effective annual rate as a decimal, and then I can convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.06/12)^12 first. As I said earlier, 0.06 divided by 12 is 0.005, so it's (1.005)^12. Now, I need to calculate that.\n\nI can use the formula for exponents, or maybe use the binomial expansion, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or natural exponentials, but perhaps it's easier to just compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest more directly. Let me see if I can compute (1.005)^12.\n\nI know that (1.005)^12 is the same as e^(12 * ln(1.005)). Maybe that's a way to compute it using continuous compounding, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, I can just compute it step by step.\n\nLet me try computing it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1.005)^1 = 1.005\n\nThen, (1.005)^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n(1.005)^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005. Let's compute that:\n\n1.010025 * 1.005 = ?\n\nWell, 1 * 1.005 = 1.005\n\n0.010025 * 1.005 = 0.010075125\n\nAdding them together: 1.005 + 0.010075125 = 1.015075125\n\nSo, (1.005)^3 \u2248 1.015075125\n\nContinuing:\n\n(1.005)^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005\n\nAgain, breaking it down:\n\n1 * 1.005 = 1.005\n\n0.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 0.015150506\n\nAdding together: 1.005 + 0.015150506 \u2248 1.020150506\n\nSo, (1.005)^4 \u2248 1.020150506\n\nHmm, this is getting tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest more smartly. Let me recall that (1 + r/n)^n can be expanded using the binomial theorem, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that (1.005)^12 is approximately equal to e^(0.06), since for small r, (1 + r/n)^n \u2248 e^r. But wait, in this case, r is 0.06, and n is 12, so r/n is 0.005, and n times that is 0.06, so indeed, (1.005)^12 \u2248 e^0.06. But wait, that's an approximation, and I think it's only exact in the limit as n approaches infinity. So, maybe it's not precise enough, but let's check.\n\ne^0.06 is approximately 1.06183654. But let me check what (1.005)^12 actually is.\n\nAlternatively, I can use logarithms. Let's compute ln(1.005) first.\n\nln(1.005) \u2248 0.00497512 (using a calculator approximation).\n\nThen, 12 * ln(1.005) \u2248 12 * 0.00497512 \u2248 0.05970144\n\nThen, e^0.05970144 \u2248 1.0616779\n\nWait, that's more accurate. So, using natural logs and exponentials, I get approximately 1.0616779.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the effective annual rate as:\n\nEAR = (1 + nominal rate / n)^n - 1\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.06/12)^12 - 1\n\nWhich is (1.005)^12 - 1\n\nAs I calculated earlier, using the natural log approach, I got approximately 1.0616779, so subtracting 1 gives 0.0616779, which as a percentage is 6.16779%.\n\nSo, rounding that to the nearest hundredth, that would be 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because when I calculated (1.005)^12 using the step-by-step method earlier, after 4 months, I had 1.020150506. Let me see how that progresses over 12 months.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute (1.005)^12 more accurately. Let me try using the formula for exponents.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\n(1 + r)^n = e^{n * ln(1 + r)}\n\nSo, with r = 0.005 and n = 12, it's e^{12 * ln(1.005)}.\n\nWe already calculated ln(1.005) as approximately 0.00497512, so 12 * 0.00497512 \u2248 0.05970144.\n\nThen, e^{0.05970144} \u2248 1.0616779, so that's the same as before.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is approximately 6.16779%, which rounds to 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute (1.005)^12 using binomial expansion up to the necessary terms, but that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\n(1 + 0.005)^12 = 1 + 12*0.005 + (12*11)/2*0.005^2 + (12*11*10)/6*0.005^3 + ... \n\nBut that might get too involved, but let's try a few terms to approximate.\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 12 * 0.005 = 0.06\n\nThird term: (12*11)/2 * (0.005)^2 = 66 * 0.000025 = 0.00165\n\nFourth term: (12*11*10)/6 * (0.005)^3 = 220 * 0.000000125 = 0.0000275\n\nFifth term: (12*11*10*9)/24 * (0.005)^4 = 495 * 0.000000000625 \u2248 0.000000309375\n\nAdding these up:\n\n1 + 0.06 = 1.06\n\n1.06 + 0.00165 = 1.06165\n\n1.06165 + 0.0000275 \u2248 1.0616775\n\n1.0616775 + 0.000000309375 \u2248 1.061677809375\n\nSo, that's about 1.0616778, which matches the earlier calculation using natural logs. So, that's reassuring.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is 1.0616778 - 1 = 0.0616778, which is 6.16778%. Rounding to the nearest hundredth, that's 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the binomial expansion.\n\nWait, the third term: (12*11)/2 = 66, and 0.005 squared is 0.000025, so 66 * 0.000025 = 0.00165. That's correct.\n\nFourth term: (12*11*10)/6 = 220, and 0.005 cubed is 0.000000125, so 220 * 0.000000125 = 0.0000275. Correct.\n\nFifth term: (12*11*10*9)/24 = (11880)/24 = 495, and 0.005^4 is 0.0000000625, so 495 * 0.0000000625 = 0.0000309375. Wait, wait, that's 0.0000309375, not 0.000000309375. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, 0.005^4 is (0.005)^2 squared, which is (0.000025)^2 = 0.0000000625. So, 495 * 0.0000000625 = 0.0000309375. So, that's correct. So, adding that to the previous total gives 1.0616775 + 0.0000309375 \u2248 1.0617084375.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated using the natural log, I got 1.0616779, which is about the same as 1.0617084375, considering that higher-order terms would add a bit more. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the effective rate is approximately 6.16778%, which rounds to 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator to be absolutely sure. If I compute (1.005)^12, what's the exact value?\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.005^12.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150506\n\n1.005^5 = 1.020150506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251013\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.025251013 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030378068\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.030378068 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035559959\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.035559959 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040757759\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040757759 * 1.005 \u2248 1.046005098\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.046005098 * 1.005 \u2248 1.051285353\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.051285353 * 1.005 \u2248 1.056607285\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.056607285 * 1.005 \u2248 1.061677904\n\nSo, that's precise. So, (1.005)^12 \u2248 1.061677904, which means the effective annual rate is 6.1677904%, which rounds to 6.17%.\n\nSo, the equivalent annual rate is approximately 6.17%.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about this another way. If I have $100 in the account, compounded monthly at 6%, how much would it be after a year?\n\nEach month, the interest is 0.5%, so:\n\nAfter 1 month: $100 * 1.005 = $100.50\n\nAfter 2 months: $100.50 * 1.005 = $101.0025\n\nAfter 3 months: $101.0025 * 1.005 \u2248 $101.5075125\n\nAnd so on, up to 12 months.\n\nBut calculating each step manually would take too long, so I can trust the formula and the step-by-step calculation I did earlier.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is 6.16779%, which is approximately 6.17% when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.17%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.17}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) that would yield the same amount as a 6% annual interest rate compounded monthly.\n\n1. **Understand the formulas**:\n   - The formula for compound interest is \\( A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt} \\).\n   - The effective annual rate (EAR) formula is \\( \\text{EAR} = (1 + \\frac{\\text{nominal rate}}{n})^n - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Plug in the values**:\n   - The nominal annual interest rate is 6%, or 0.06 as a decimal.\n   - Compounded monthly, so \\( n = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the effective annual rate**:\n   - Compute \\( (1 + \\frac{0.06}{12})^{12} \\).\n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \\), so we need to compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\).\n\n4. **Compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\)**:\n   - Using the natural logarithm and exponential function, we find \\( \\ln(1.005) \\approx 0.00497512 \\).\n   - Multiply by 12: \\( 12 \\times 0.00497512 \\approx 0.05970144 \\).\n   - Exponentiate: \\( e^{0.05970144} \\approx 1.0616779 \\).\n\n5. **Convert to effective annual rate**:\n   - Subtract 1: \\( 1.0616779 - 1 = 0.0616779 \\).\n   - Convert to percentage: \\( 0.0616779 \\times 100 \\approx 6.16779\\% \\).\n\n6. **Round to the nearest hundredth**:\n   - The result is approximately 6.17%.\n\nThus, the equivalent annual interest rate is \\(\\boxed{6.17}\\).",

So, that's reassuring.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is 1.0616778 - 1 = 0.0616778, which is 6.16778%. Rounding to the nearest hundredth, that's 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the binomial expansion.\n\nWait, the third term: (12*11)/2 = 66, and 0.005 squared is 0.000025, so 66 * 0.000025 = 0.00165. That's correct.\n\nFourth term: (12*11*10)/6 = 220, and 0.005 cubed is 0.000000125, so 220 * 0.000000125 = 0.0000275. Correct.\n\nFifth term: (12*11*10*9)/24 = (11880)/24 = 495, and 0.005^4 is 0.0000000625, so 495 * 0.0000000625 = 0.0000309375. Wait, wait, that's 0.0000309375, not 0.000000309375. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, 0.005^4 is (0.005)^2 squared, which is (0.000025)^2 = 0.0000000625. So, 495 * 0.0000000625 = 0.0000309375. So, that's correct. So, adding that to the previous total gives 1.0616775 + 0.0000309375 \u2248 1.0617084375.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated using the natural log, I got 1.0616779, which is about the same as 1.0617084375, considering that higher-order terms would add a bit more. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the effective rate is approximately 6.16778%, which rounds to 6.17%.\n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator to be absolutely sure. If I compute (1.005)^12, what's the exact value?\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.005^12.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1.005^1 = 1.005\n\n1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025\n\n1.005^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 \u2248 1.015075125\n\n1.005^4 = 1.015075125 * 1.005 \u2248 1.020150506\n\n1.005^5 = 1.020150506 * 1.005 \u2248 1.025251013\n\n1.005^6 \u2248 1.025251013 * 1.005 \u2248 1.030378068\n\n1.005^7 \u2248 1.030378068 * 1.005 \u2248 1.035559959\n\n1.005^8 \u2248 1.035559959 * 1.005 \u2248 1.040757759\n\n1.005^9 \u2248 1.040757759 * 1.005 \u2248 1.046005098\n\n1.005^10 \u2248 1.046005098 * 1.005 \u2248 1.051285353\n\n1.005^11 \u2248 1.051285353 * 1.005 \u2248 1.056607285\n\n1.005^12 \u2248 1.056607285 * 1.005 \u2248 1.061677904\n\nSo, that's precise. So, (1.005)^12 \u2248 1.061677904, which means the effective annual rate is 6.1677904%, which rounds to 6.17%.\n\nSo, the equivalent annual rate is approximately 6.17%.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about this another way. If I have $100 in the account, compounded monthly at 6%, how much would it be after a year?\n\nEach month, the interest is 0.5%, so:\n\nAfter 1 month: $100 * 1.005 = $100.50\n\nAfter 2 months: $100.50 * 1.005 = $101.0025\n\nAfter 3 months: $101.0025 * 1.005 \u2248 $101.5075125\n\nAnd so on, up to 12 months.\n\nBut calculating each step manually would take too long, so I can trust the formula and the step-by-step calculation I did earlier.\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is 6.16779%, which is approximately 6.17% when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.17%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equivalent annual interest rate is \\boxed{6.17}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the equivalent annual interest rate \\( r \\) that would yield the same amount as a 6% annual interest rate compounded monthly.\n\n1. **Understand the formulas**:\n   - The formula for compound interest is \\( A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt} \\).\n   - The effective annual rate (EAR) formula is \\( \\text{EAR} = (1 + \\frac{\\text{nominal rate}}{n})^n - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Plug in the values**:\n   - The nominal annual interest rate is 6%, or 0.06 as a decimal.\n   - Compounded monthly, so \\( n = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the effective annual rate**:\n   - Compute \\( (1 + \\frac{0.06}{12})^{12} \\).\n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \\), so we need to compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\).\n\n4. **Compute \\( (1.005)^{12} \\)**:\n   - Using the natural logarithm and exponential function, we find \\( \\ln(1.005) \\approx 0.00497512 \\).\n   - Multiply by 12: \\( 12 \\times 0.00497512 \\approx 0.05970144 \\).\n   - Exponentiate: \\( e^{0.05970144} \\approx 1.0616779 \\).\n\n5. **Convert to effective annual rate**:\n   - Subtract 1: \\( 1.0616779 - 1 = 0.0616779 \\).\n   - Convert to percentage: \\( 0.0616779 \\times 100 \\approx 6.16779\\% \\).\n\n6. **Round to the nearest hundredth**:\n   - The result is approximately 6.17%.\n\nThus, the equivalent annual interest rate is \\(\\boxed{6.17}\\).",
