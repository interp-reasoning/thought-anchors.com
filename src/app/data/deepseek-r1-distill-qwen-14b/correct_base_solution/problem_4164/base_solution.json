  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a cubic polynomial p(x), and it satisfies p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. I need to find p(5). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a cubic polynomial has the form p(x) = ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, d are constants. Since it's a cubic, it can be uniquely determined by four points, which is exactly what we have here: four values of n where p(n) is given. So, I can set up a system of equations using these points and solve for the coefficients a, b, c, d. Then, once I have the polynomial, I can plug in x = 5 to find p(5). That seems straightforward, but solving a system of four equations might be a bit tedious. I wonder if there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of interpolation. Since p(x) is a cubic polynomial passing through four points, I can construct it using Lagrange interpolation or Newton's divided differences. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that sometimes when dealing with polynomials and given points, it's helpful to consider constructing another polynomial that relates to the given one. For instance, if we have a polynomial q(x) such that q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1, then for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, q(x) would be zero. So, q(x) would have roots at x = 1, 2, 3, 4. Since q(x) is x\u00b2p(x) - 1, and p(x) is cubic, then x\u00b2p(x) would be a quintic (degree 5) polynomial, so q(x) is also a quintic. Therefore, q(x) can be written as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) times some linear factor, because it's a quintic and we already have four roots. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m), where k and m are constants to be determined. But wait, q(x) is also equal to x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is a cubic, x\u00b2p(x) is a quintic, so q(x) is a quintic, which matches. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nx\u00b2p(x) - 1 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m)\n\nNow, to find k and m, I can plug in values of x that are not roots of q(x). But wait, the roots of q(x) are x = 1, 2, 3, 4, so plugging in these values just gives 0 = 0, which doesn't help. Maybe I can choose other values, like x = 0 or x = 5, to create equations for k and m.\n\nLet me try x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into both sides:\n\nLeft side: (0)\u00b2p(0) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1\n\nRight side: (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(k*0 + m) = (24)(m)\n\nSo, -1 = 24m \u21d2 m = -1/24\n\nOkay, so m is -1/24. Now, let's find k. Let's choose another value, say x = 5.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find p(5), so maybe it's better to set up the equation for x = 5. Let's see.\n\nWait, let me first try x = 0 to find m, which I did, and now let's try x = 5.\n\nBut wait, if I plug in x = 5 into the equation:\n\nLeft side: (5)\u00b2p(5) - 1 = 25p(5) - 1\n\nRight side: (5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(k*5 + m) = (4)(3)(2)(1)(5k + m) = 24*(5k + m)\n\nSo, 25p(5) - 1 = 24*(5k + m)\n\nBut I don't know p(5) yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So, maybe I need another equation to find k first.\n\nLet me try x = 0, which I did, giving m = -1/24.\n\nNow, let's try x = something else, maybe x = -1, to get another equation.\n\nPlugging x = -1 into both sides:\n\nLeft side: (-1)\u00b2p(-1) - 1 = p(-1) - 1\n\nRight side: (-1 - 1)(-1 - 2)(-1 - 3)(-1 - 4)(k*(-1) + m) = (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-k + m) = (2*3*4*5)(-k + m) = 120*(-k + m)\n\nSo, p(-1) - 1 = 120*(-k + m)\n\nBut I don't know p(-1). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand both sides and compare coefficients.\n\nLet me try expanding q(x) on both sides.\n\nFirst, q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is cubic, let's write p(x) = ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d. Then, x\u00b2p(x) = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2. So, q(x) = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 - 1.\n\nOn the other hand, q(x) is also equal to (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m). Let me expand this.\n\nFirst, let's compute (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4). Let me denote this as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = [(x - 1)(x - 2)][(x - 3)(x - 4)]\n\nFirst, compute (x - 1)(x - 2) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2\n\nSimilarly, (x - 3)(x - 4) = x\u00b2 - 7x + 12\n\nNow, multiply these two quadratics together:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3x + 2)(x\u00b2 - 7x + 12) = x^4 - 7x\u00b3 + 12x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b3 + 21x\u00b2 - 36x + 2x\u00b2 - 14x + 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4 + (-7x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b3) + (12x\u00b2 + 21x\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2) + (-36x -14x) + 24\n\nWhich is:\n\nx^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24\n\nSo, (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = x^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24\n\nNow, multiply this by (kx + m):\n\n(x^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24)(kx + m) =\n\nk x^5 + m x^4 - 10k x^4 - 10m x^3 + 35k x^3 + 35m x^2 - 50k x^2 - 50m x + 24k x + 24m\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nk x^5 + (m - 10k) x^4 + (-10m + 35k) x^3 + (35m - 50k) x^2 + (-50m + 24k) x + 24m\n\nSo, the expanded form of q(x) is:\n\nq(x) = k x^5 + (m - 10k) x^4 + (-10m + 35k) x^3 + (35m - 50k) x^2 + (-50m + 24k) x + 24m\n\nBut we also have q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 - 1\n\nSo, equating coefficients for each power of x:\n\nFor x^5: k = a\n\nFor x^4: m - 10k = b\n\nFor x^3: -10m + 35k = c\n\nFor x^2: 35m - 50k = d\n\nFor x: -50m + 24k = 0 (since there's no x term on the left side, it's zero)\n\nFor constant term: 24m = -1 (since the constant term on the left is -1)\n\nWait, that last equation is 24m = -1, so m = -1/24, which matches what I found earlier by plugging in x = 0.\n\nNow, from the x term: -50m + 24k = 0\n\nWe can plug m = -1/24 into this:\n\n-50*(-1/24) + 24k = 0 \u21d2 50/24 + 24k = 0 \u21d2 25/12 + 24k = 0 \u21d2 24k = -25/12 \u21d2 k = (-25/12)/24 = (-25)/(12*24) = (-25)/288\n\nSo, k = -25/288\n\nNow, let's find the other coefficients using m and k.\n\nFrom x^4: m - 10k = b\n\nm = -1/24, k = -25/288\n\nSo, b = (-1/24) - 10*(-25/288) = (-1/24) + (250/288)\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 288:\n\n(-1/24) = (-12/288), so:\n\nb = (-12/288) + (250/288) = (238)/288 = 119/144\n\nSimilarly, from x^3: -10m + 35k = c\n\nPlugging in m and k:\n\nc = -10*(-1/24) + 35*(-25/288) = 10/24 - 875/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n10/24 = 120/288, so:\n\nc = 120/288 - 875/288 = (-755)/288\n\nFrom x^2: 35m - 50k = d\n\nd = 35*(-1/24) - 50*(-25/288) = (-35/24) + (1250/288)\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-35/24 = -420/288, so:\n\nd = (-420/288) + 1250/288 = (830)/288 = 415/144\n\nFrom x^5: k = a \u21d2 a = -25/288\n\nNow, so p(x) = a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na = -25/288\n\nb = 119/144\n\nc = -755/288\n\nd = 415/144\n\nSo, p(x) = (-25/288)x\u00b3 + (119/144)x\u00b2 + (-755/288)x + 415/144\n\nNow, I need to find p(5). Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each coefficient multiplied by the respective power of 5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. (-25/288)x\u00b3 at x=5: (-25/288)*(125) = (-25*125)/288 = (-3125)/288\n\n2. (119/144)x\u00b2 at x=5: (119/144)*(25) = (2975)/144\n\n3. (-755/288)x at x=5: (-755/288)*5 = (-3775)/288\n\n4. 415/144 is the constant term.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\np(5) = (-3125/288) + (2975/144) + (-3775/288) + 415/144\n\nFirst, let's convert all to 288 denominators:\n\n-3125/288 remains as is.\n\n2975/144 = (2975*2)/288 = 5950/288\n\n-3775/288 remains as is.\n\n415/144 = (415*2)/288 = 830/288\n\nNow, sum all numerators:\n\n-3125 + 5950 - 3775 + 830\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nSo, total numerator is -120, denominator is 288.\n\nThus, p(5) = (-120)/288 = Simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24: -5/12\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, let me recompute the sum:\n\n-3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, p(5) = -120/288. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 24: -5/12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the arithmetic because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in expanding or in the coefficients.\n\nWait, let me verify the coefficients again.\n\nFrom earlier steps:\n\nWe had:\n\nq(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m)\n\nWe found m = -1/24 and k = -25/288\n\nThen, from equating coefficients, we found a = k = -25/288\n\nb = m -10k = (-1/24) -10*(-25/288) = (-1/24) + 250/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-1/24 = -12/288\n\nSo, b = (-12 + 250)/288 = 238/288 = 119/144\n\nSimilarly, c = -10m +35k = 10/24 + 35*(-25/288) = 10/24 - 875/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n10/24 = 120/288\n\nSo, c = 120 - 875 = -755/288\n\nd = 35m -50k = 35*(-1/24) -50*(-25/288) = -35/24 + 1250/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-35/24 = -420/288\n\nSo, d = (-420 + 1250)/288 = 830/288 = 415/144\n\nSo, coefficients are correct.\n\nNow, let's compute p(5):\n\np(5) = (-25/288)*(125) + (119/144)*(25) + (-755/288)*(5) + 415/144\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-25/288 * 125 = (-3125)/288\n\n119/144 * 25 = (2975)/144\n\n-755/288 *5 = (-3775)/288\n\n415/144 remains as is.\n\nConvert all to 288 denominator:\n\n-3125/288\n\n2975/144 = 5950/288\n\n-3775/288\n\n415/144 = 830/288\n\nNow, sum:\n\n-3125 + 5950 - 3775 + 830\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nStart with -3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nSo, total is -120/288 = -5/12\n\nWait, but that seems odd because p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n=1,2,3,4, and p(5) is negative? Let me think if that makes sense.\n\nWait, p(x) is a cubic polynomial, so it can indeed take negative values. But let me check if I made any calculation mistake because it's unusual to get a negative value, but not impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach is to use the method of finite differences or to set up the system of equations and solve for the coefficients. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lagrange interpolation formula.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe Lagrange interpolation formula for a cubic polynomial passing through four points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) is:\n\np(x) = y0 * L0(x) + y1 * L1(x) + y2 * L2(x) + y3 * L3(x)\n\nWhere Lk(x) is the Lagrange basis polynomial:\n\nLk(x) = product from i=0 to 3, i\u2260k of (x - xi)/(xk - xi)\n\nIn our case, the points are (1,1), (2,1/4), (3,1/9), (4,1/16)\n\nSo, let me write down the Lagrange basis polynomials.\n\nCompute L0(x) for point x=1:\n\nL0(x) = [(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)] = [(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(-1)(-2)(-3)] = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)/(-6)\n\nSimilarly, L1(x) for x=2:\n\nL1(x) = [(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(2-1)(2-3)(2-4)] = [(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(1)(-1)(-2)] = (x-1)(x-3)(x-4)/2\n\nL2(x) for x=3:\n\nL2(x) = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)] / [(3-1)(3-2)(3-4)] = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)] / [(2)(1)(-1)] = (x-1)(x-2)(x-4)/(-2)\n\nL3(x) for x=4:\n\nL3(x) = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)] / [(4-1)(4-2)(4-3)] = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)] / [(3)(2)(1)] = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)/6\n\nSo, p(x) = (1)*L0(x) + (1/4)*L1(x) + (1/9)*L2(x) + (1/16)*L3(x)\n\nNow, let me compute each term at x=5.\n\nFirst, compute L0(5):\n\nL0(5) = (5-2)(5-3)(5-4)/(-6) = (3)(2)(1)/(-6) = 6/(-6) = -1\n\nSo, first term: 1*(-1) = -1\n\nSecond term: (1/4)*L1(5)\n\nCompute L1(5):\n\nL1(5) = (5-1)(5-3)(5-4)/2 = (4)(2)(1)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nSo, second term: (1/4)*4 = 1\n\nThird term: (1/9)*L2(5)\n\nCompute L2(5):\n\nL2(5) = (5-1)(5-2)(5-4)/(-2) = (4)(3)(1)/(-2) = 12/(-2) = -6\n\nSo, third term: (1/9)*(-6) = -6/9 = -2/3\n\nFourth term: (1/16)*L3(5)\n\nCompute L3(5):\n\nL3(5) = (5-1)(5-2)(5-3)/6 = (4)(3)(2)/6 = 24/6 = 4\n\nSo, fourth term: (1/16)*4 = 4/16 = 1/4\n\nNow, sum all four terms:\n\n-1 + 1 - 2/3 + 1/4\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-1 + 1 = 0\n\n0 - 2/3 = -2/3\n\n-2/3 + 1/4 = (-8/12 + 3/12) = (-5)/12\n\nSo, p(5) = -5/12\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me just think again: p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n=1,2,3,4, and p(5) = -5/12. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method.\n\nWait, another approach: since q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1, and q(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(kx + m), and we found k = -25/288 and m = -1/24.\n\nSo, q(5) = (5)^2 p(5) - 1 = 25p(5) - 1\n\nBut also, q(5) = (5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(k*5 + m) = 4*3*2*1*(5k + m) = 24*(5k + m)\n\nWe found k = -25/288 and m = -1/24.\n\nSo, 5k + m = 5*(-25/288) + (-1/24) = (-125/288) + (-12/288) = (-137)/288\n\nThus, q(5) = 24*(-137)/288 = (-137)/12\n\nBut q(5) is also 25p(5) - 1, so:\n\n25p(5) - 1 = (-137)/12\n\nThen, 25p(5) = (-137)/12 + 1 = (-137 + 12)/12 = (-125)/12\n\nThus, p(5) = (-125)/(12*25) = (-125)/300 = (-5)/12\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, p(5) = -5/12.\n\nSo, after verifying with two different methods\u2014expanding the polynomial and using Lagrange interpolation\u2014I get the same result. Thus, I'm confident that p(5) = -5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( p(5) \\) is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{5}{12}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a cubic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) that satisfies \\( p(n) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\), we need to find \\( p(5) \\).\n\nFirst, we define a new polynomial \\( q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1 \\).

For instance, if we have a polynomial q(x) such that q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1, then for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, q(x) would be zero. So, q(x) would have roots at x = 1, 2, 3, 4. Since q(x) is x\u00b2p(x) - 1, and p(x) is cubic, then x\u00b2p(x) would be a quintic (degree 5) polynomial, so q(x) is also a quintic. Therefore, q(x) can be written as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) times some linear factor, because it's a quintic and we already have four roots. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m), where k and m are constants to be determined. But wait, q(x) is also equal to x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is a cubic, x\u00b2p(x) is a quintic, so q(x) is a quintic, which matches. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nx\u00b2p(x) - 1 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m)\n\nNow, to find k and m, I can plug in values of x that are not roots of q(x). But wait, the roots of q(x) are x = 1, 2, 3, 4, so plugging in these values just gives 0 = 0, which doesn't help. Maybe I can choose other values, like x = 0 or x = 5, to create equations for k and m.\n\nLet me try x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into both sides:\n\nLeft side: (0)\u00b2p(0) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1\n\nRight side: (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(k*0 + m) = (24)(m)\n\nSo, -1 = 24m \u21d2 m = -1/24\n\nOkay, so m is -1/24. Now, let's find k. Let's choose another value, say x = 5.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find p(5), so maybe it's better to set up the equation for x = 5. Let's see.\n\nWait, let me first try x = 0 to find m, which I did, and now let's try x = 5.\n\nBut wait, if I plug in x = 5 into the equation:\n\nLeft side: (5)\u00b2p(5) - 1 = 25p(5) - 1\n\nRight side: (5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(k*5 + m) = (4)(3)(2)(1)(5k + m) = 24*(5k + m)\n\nSo, 25p(5) - 1 = 24*(5k + m)\n\nBut I don't know p(5) yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So, maybe I need another equation to find k first.\n\nLet me try x = 0, which I did, giving m = -1/24.\n\nNow, let's try x = something else, maybe x = -1, to get another equation.\n\nPlugging x = -1 into both sides:\n\nLeft side: (-1)\u00b2p(-1) - 1 = p(-1) - 1\n\nRight side: (-1 - 1)(-1 - 2)(-1 - 3)(-1 - 4)(k*(-1) + m) = (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-k + m) = (2*3*4*5)(-k + m) = 120*(-k + m)\n\nSo, p(-1) - 1 = 120*(-k + m)\n\nBut I don't know p(-1). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand both sides and compare coefficients.\n\nLet me try expanding q(x) on both sides.\n\nFirst, q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is cubic, let's write p(x) = ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d. Then, x\u00b2p(x) = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2. So, q(x) = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 - 1.\n\nOn the other hand, q(x) is also equal to (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m). Let me expand this.\n\nFirst, let's compute (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4). Let me denote this as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = [(x - 1)(x - 2)][(x - 3)(x - 4)]\n\nFirst, compute (x - 1)(x - 2) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2\n\nSimilarly, (x - 3)(x - 4) = x\u00b2 - 7x + 12\n\nNow, multiply these two quadratics together:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3x + 2)(x\u00b2 - 7x + 12) = x^4 - 7x\u00b3 + 12x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b3 + 21x\u00b2 - 36x + 2x\u00b2 - 14x + 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4 + (-7x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b3) + (12x\u00b2 + 21x\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2) + (-36x -14x) + 24\n\nWhich is:\n\nx^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24\n\nSo, (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = x^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24\n\nNow, multiply this by (kx + m):\n\n(x^4 - 10x\u00b3 + 35x\u00b2 - 50x + 24)(kx + m) =\n\nk x^5 + m x^4 - 10k x^4 - 10m x^3 + 35k x^3 + 35m x^2 - 50k x^2 - 50m x + 24k x + 24m\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nk x^5 + (m - 10k) x^4 + (-10m + 35k) x^3 + (35m - 50k) x^2 + (-50m + 24k) x + 24m\n\nSo, the expanded form of q(x) is:\n\nq(x) = k x^5 + (m - 10k) x^4 + (-10m + 35k) x^3 + (35m - 50k) x^2 + (-50m + 24k) x + 24m\n\nBut we also have q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 = a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 - 1\n\nSo, equating coefficients for each power of x:\n\nFor x^5: k = a\n\nFor x^4: m - 10k = b\n\nFor x^3: -10m + 35k = c\n\nFor x^2: 35m - 50k = d\n\nFor x: -50m + 24k = 0 (since there's no x term on the left side, it's zero)\n\nFor constant term: 24m = -1 (since the constant term on the left is -1)\n\nWait, that last equation is 24m = -1, so m = -1/24, which matches what I found earlier by plugging in x = 0.\n\nNow, from the x term: -50m + 24k = 0\n\nWe can plug m = -1/24 into this:\n\n-50*(-1/24) + 24k = 0 \u21d2 50/24 + 24k = 0 \u21d2 25/12 + 24k = 0 \u21d2 24k = -25/12 \u21d2 k = (-25/12)/24 = (-25)/(12*24) = (-25)/288\n\nSo, k = -25/288\n\nNow, let's find the other coefficients using m and k.\n\nFrom x^4: m - 10k = b\n\nm = -1/24, k = -25/288\n\nSo, b = (-1/24) - 10*(-25/288) = (-1/24) + (250/288)\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 288:\n\n(-1/24) = (-12/288), so:\n\nb = (-12/288) + (250/288) = (238)/288 = 119/144\n\nSimilarly, from x^3: -10m + 35k = c\n\nPlugging in m and k:\n\nc = -10*(-1/24) + 35*(-25/288) = 10/24 - 875/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n10/24 = 120/288, so:\n\nc = 120/288 - 875/288 = (-755)/288\n\nFrom x^2: 35m - 50k = d\n\nd = 35*(-1/24) - 50*(-25/288) = (-35/24) + (1250/288)\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-35/24 = -420/288, so:\n\nd = (-420/288) + 1250/288 = (830)/288 = 415/144\n\nFrom x^5: k = a \u21d2 a = -25/288\n\nNow, so p(x) = a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na = -25/288\n\nb = 119/144\n\nc = -755/288\n\nd = 415/144\n\nSo, p(x) = (-25/288)x\u00b3 + (119/144)x\u00b2 + (-755/288)x + 415/144\n\nNow, I need to find p(5). Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each coefficient multiplied by the respective power of 5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. (-25/288)x\u00b3 at x=5: (-25/288)*(125) = (-25*125)/288 = (-3125)/288\n\n2. (119/144)x\u00b2 at x=5: (119/144)*(25) = (2975)/144\n\n3. (-755/288)x at x=5: (-755/288)*5 = (-3775)/288\n\n4. 415/144 is the constant term.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\np(5) = (-3125/288) + (2975/144) + (-3775/288) + 415/144\n\nFirst, let's convert all to 288 denominators:\n\n-3125/288 remains as is.\n\n2975/144 = (2975*2)/288 = 5950/288\n\n-3775/288 remains as is.\n\n415/144 = (415*2)/288 = 830/288\n\nNow, sum all numerators:\n\n-3125 + 5950 - 3775 + 830\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nSo, total numerator is -120, denominator is 288.\n\nThus, p(5) = (-120)/288 = Simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24: -5/12\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, let me recompute the sum:\n\n-3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, p(5) = -120/288. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 24: -5/12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the arithmetic because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in expanding or in the coefficients.\n\nWait, let me verify the coefficients again.\n\nFrom earlier steps:\n\nWe had:\n\nq(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(kx + m)\n\nWe found m = -1/24 and k = -25/288\n\nThen, from equating coefficients, we found a = k = -25/288\n\nb = m -10k = (-1/24) -10*(-25/288) = (-1/24) + 250/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-1/24 = -12/288\n\nSo, b = (-12 + 250)/288 = 238/288 = 119/144\n\nSimilarly, c = -10m +35k = 10/24 + 35*(-25/288) = 10/24 - 875/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n10/24 = 120/288\n\nSo, c = 120 - 875 = -755/288\n\nd = 35m -50k = 35*(-1/24) -50*(-25/288) = -35/24 + 1250/288\n\nConvert to 288 denominator:\n\n-35/24 = -420/288\n\nSo, d = (-420 + 1250)/288 = 830/288 = 415/144\n\nSo, coefficients are correct.\n\nNow, let's compute p(5):\n\np(5) = (-25/288)*(125) + (119/144)*(25) + (-755/288)*(5) + 415/144\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-25/288 * 125 = (-3125)/288\n\n119/144 * 25 = (2975)/144\n\n-755/288 *5 = (-3775)/288\n\n415/144 remains as is.\n\nConvert all to 288 denominator:\n\n-3125/288\n\n2975/144 = 5950/288\n\n-3775/288\n\n415/144 = 830/288\n\nNow, sum:\n\n-3125 + 5950 - 3775 + 830\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nStart with -3125 + 5950 = 2825\n\n2825 - 3775 = -950\n\n-950 + 830 = -120\n\nSo, total is -120/288 = -5/12\n\nWait, but that seems odd because p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n=1,2,3,4, and p(5) is negative? Let me think if that makes sense.\n\nWait, p(x) is a cubic polynomial, so it can indeed take negative values. But let me check if I made any calculation mistake because it's unusual to get a negative value, but not impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach is to use the method of finite differences or to set up the system of equations and solve for the coefficients. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lagrange interpolation formula.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe Lagrange interpolation formula for a cubic polynomial passing through four points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) is:\n\np(x) = y0 * L0(x) + y1 * L1(x) + y2 * L2(x) + y3 * L3(x)\n\nWhere Lk(x) is the Lagrange basis polynomial:\n\nLk(x) = product from i=0 to 3, i\u2260k of (x - xi)/(xk - xi)\n\nIn our case, the points are (1,1), (2,1/4), (3,1/9), (4,1/16)\n\nSo, let me write down the Lagrange basis polynomials.\n\nCompute L0(x) for point x=1:\n\nL0(x) = [(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)] = [(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(-1)(-2)(-3)] = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)/(-6)\n\nSimilarly, L1(x) for x=2:\n\nL1(x) = [(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(2-1)(2-3)(2-4)] = [(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)] / [(1)(-1)(-2)] = (x-1)(x-3)(x-4)/2\n\nL2(x) for x=3:\n\nL2(x) = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)] / [(3-1)(3-2)(3-4)] = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)] / [(2)(1)(-1)] = (x-1)(x-2)(x-4)/(-2)\n\nL3(x) for x=4:\n\nL3(x) = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)] / [(4-1)(4-2)(4-3)] = [(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)] / [(3)(2)(1)] = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)/6\n\nSo, p(x) = (1)*L0(x) + (1/4)*L1(x) + (1/9)*L2(x) + (1/16)*L3(x)\n\nNow, let me compute each term at x=5.\n\nFirst, compute L0(5):\n\nL0(5) = (5-2)(5-3)(5-4)/(-6) = (3)(2)(1)/(-6) = 6/(-6) = -1\n\nSo, first term: 1*(-1) = -1\n\nSecond term: (1/4)*L1(5)\n\nCompute L1(5):\n\nL1(5) = (5-1)(5-3)(5-4)/2 = (4)(2)(1)/2 = 8/2 = 4\n\nSo, second term: (1/4)*4 = 1\n\nThird term: (1/9)*L2(5)\n\nCompute L2(5):\n\nL2(5) = (5-1)(5-2)(5-4)/(-2) = (4)(3)(1)/(-2) = 12/(-2) = -6\n\nSo, third term: (1/9)*(-6) = -6/9 = -2/3\n\nFourth term: (1/16)*L3(5)\n\nCompute L3(5):\n\nL3(5) = (5-1)(5-2)(5-3)/6 = (4)(3)(2)/6 = 24/6 = 4\n\nSo, fourth term: (1/16)*4 = 4/16 = 1/4\n\nNow, sum all four terms:\n\n-1 + 1 - 2/3 + 1/4\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-1 + 1 = 0\n\n0 - 2/3 = -2/3\n\n-2/3 + 1/4 = (-8/12 + 3/12) = (-5)/12\n\nSo, p(5) = -5/12\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me just think again: p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n=1,2,3,4, and p(5) = -5/12. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method.\n\nWait, another approach: since q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1, and q(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(kx + m), and we found k = -25/288 and m = -1/24.\n\nSo, q(5) = (5)^2 p(5) - 1 = 25p(5) - 1\n\nBut also, q(5) = (5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(k*5 + m) = 4*3*2*1*(5k + m) = 24*(5k + m)\n\nWe found k = -25/288 and m = -1/24.\n\nSo, 5k + m = 5*(-25/288) + (-1/24) = (-125/288) + (-12/288) = (-137)/288\n\nThus, q(5) = 24*(-137)/288 = (-137)/12\n\nBut q(5) is also 25p(5) - 1, so:\n\n25p(5) - 1 = (-137)/12\n\nThen, 25p(5) = (-137)/12 + 1 = (-137 + 12)/12 = (-125)/12\n\nThus, p(5) = (-125)/(12*25) = (-125)/300 = (-5)/12\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, p(5) = -5/12.\n\nSo, after verifying with two different methods\u2014expanding the polynomial and using Lagrange interpolation\u2014I get the same result. Thus, I'm confident that p(5) = -5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( p(5) \\) is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{5}{12}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a cubic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) that satisfies \\( p(n) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\), we need to find \\( p(5) \\).\n\nFirst, we define a new polynomial \\( q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1 \\).
