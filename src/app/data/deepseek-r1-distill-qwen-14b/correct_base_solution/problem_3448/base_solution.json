  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to compute the value of \\(\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}}\\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the binomial coefficient for a real number \\(x\\) and a nonnegative integer \\(k\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\binom{x}{k} = \\frac{x(x - 1)(x - 2) \\dots (x - k + 1)}{k!}\n\\]\nSo, in this case, I need to compute \\(\\binom{1/2}{2014}\\). Let me write that out:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2\\right) \\dots \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2013\\right)}{2014!}\n\\]\nSimplifying each term in the numerator, we can write each as \\(\\frac{1}{2} - n = \\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) ranges from 0 to 2013. So, each term is \\(\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:\n\\[\n\\prod_{n=0}^{2013} \\left(\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2^{2014}} \\prod_{n=0}^{2013} (1 - 2n)\n\\]\nWait, let me compute that product. The product is:\n\\[\n(1)(-1)(-3)(-5)\\dots(-4025)\n\\]\nBecause when \\(n=0\\), it's 1; when \\(n=1\\), it's -1; when \\(n=2\\), it's -3, and so on until \\(n=2013\\), which is \\(1 - 2(2013) = 1 - 4026 = -4025\\).\n\nSo, the product is \\(1 \\times (-1) \\times (-3) \\times \\dots \\times (-4025)\\). That's a product of 2014 terms, each decreasing by 2, starting from 1 and going down to -4025.\n\nI can factor out a \\((-1)\\) from each term after the first one. Wait, actually, let's see: from \\(n=1\\) to \\(n=2013\\), each term is negative. So, the number of negative terms is 2013. Therefore, the product can be written as:\n\\[\n1 \\times (-1)^{2013} \\times (1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\dots \\times 4025)\n\\]\nBecause each negative term contributes a \\(-1\\), and there are 2013 such terms. So, \\((-1)^{2013} = -1\\), since 2013 is odd.\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\\[\n-1 \\times (1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\dots \\times 4025)\n\\]\nNow, the product \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\dots \\times (2k - 1)\\) is known as the double factorial, often denoted as \\((2k - 1)!!\\). In this case, \\(2k - 1 = 4025\\), so \\(k = 2013\\). Therefore, the product is \\(4025!!\\).\n\nBut wait, I have a negative sign in front, so the entire product is \\(-4025!!\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the numerator of \\(\\binom{1/2}{2014}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{-4025!!}{2^{2014}}\n\\]\nSo, now, the binomial coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{-4025!!}{2^{2014} \\times 2014!}\n\\]\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can relate this to something else. I remember that double factorials can be related to regular factorials. Specifically, for an odd number \\(2k - 1\\), we have:\n\\[\n(2k - 1)!! = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}\n\\]\nLet me verify that: yes, because \\((2k)! = 2^k k! \\times (2k - 1)!!\\). So, indeed, \\((2k - 1)!! = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}\\).\n\nIn our case, \\(2k - 1 = 4025\\), so \\(2k = 4026\\), which means \\(k = 2013\\). Therefore:\n\\[\n4025!! = \\frac{4026!}{2^{2013} \\times 2013!}\n\\]\nSubstituting back into our expression for the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{-4026!}{2^{2013} \\times 2013! \\times 2^{2014} \\times 2014!}\n\\]\nWait, let me compute the exponents of 2. We have \\(2^{2013}\\) and \\(2^{2014}\\), so together that's \\(2^{4027}\\). So, the denominator becomes:\n\\[\n2^{4027} \\times 2013! \\times 2014!\n\\]\nBut 2014! is 2014 \u00d7 2013!, so we can write:\n\\[\n2^{4027} \\times 2013! \\times 2014 \\times 2013! = 2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2\n\\]\nTherefore, the binomial coefficient becomes:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{-4026!}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\n\\]\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can relate it to the central binomial coefficient or something else.\n\nWait, let's recall that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the central binomial coefficient. In this case, 4028 is 2 \u00d7 2014, so \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\) is the central binomial coefficient. Let me write that down:\n\\[\n\\binom{4028}{2014} = \\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}\n\\]\nSo, in the denominator of our original expression, we have \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}\\).\n\nNow, let's go back to our original expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{-4026!}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\\right) \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}}\n\\]\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator of the entire expression:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-4026!}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\\right) \\cdot 4^{2014}\n\\]\nSince \\(4^{2014} = (2^2)^{2014} = 2^{4028}\\), we can rewrite this as:\n\\[\n\\frac{-4026! \\times 2^{4028}}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2} = \\frac{-4026! \\times 2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\n\\]\nBecause \\(2^{4028}/2^{4027} = 2\\). So, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{-4026! \\times 2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\n\\]\nNow, let's look at the denominator of the entire expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}\n\\]\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{-4026! \\times 2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2}}{\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}} = \\frac{-4026! \\times 2 \\times (2014!)^2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2 \\times 4028!}\n\\]\nLet me see if I can simplify this.\n\nFirst, note that \\(4028! = 4028 \\times 4027 \\times 4026!\\). So, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{-4026! \\times 2 \\times (2014!)^2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2 \\times 4028 \\times 4027 \\times 4026!}\n\\]\nThe \\(4026!\\) cancels out, leaving:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times (2014!)^2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2 \\times 4028 \\times 4027}\n\\]\nNow, let's simplify \\((2014!)^2\\) over \\((2013!)^2\\). We know that \\(2014! = 2014 \\times 2013!\\), so:\n\\[\n\\frac{(2014!)^2}{(2013!)^2} = \\frac{(2014 \\times 2013!)^2}{(2013!)^2} = 2014^2\n\\]\nTherefore, substituting back, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times 2014^2}{2014 \\times 4028 \\times 4027}\n\\]\nSimplify the numerator and denominator. The 2014 in the denominator cancels one 2014 in the numerator:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times 2014}{4028 \\times 4027}\n\\]\nNow, notice that 4028 is 2 \u00d7 2014, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times 2014}{2 \\times 2014 \\times 4027}\n\\]\nThe 2 and 2014 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{4027}\n\\]\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to \\(-\\frac{1}{4027}\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Especially with the signs and the factorials.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{1/2}{2014}\\) had a negative sign because the product had an odd number of negative terms. So, that negative sign carried through all the way to the final result, giving us a negative value.\n\nBut let's think about whether this makes sense. The central binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\) is positive, and \\(4^{2014}\\) is positive. The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{1/2}{2014}\\) is negative because, as we saw, the product in the numerator had 2013 negative terms, which is an odd number, making the overall product negative. So, when we multiply by 4^{2014}, which is positive, the numerator of the entire expression is negative, and the denominator is positive, so the overall result is negative.\n\nTherefore, the final answer being negative seems correct. So, \\(-\\frac{1}{4027}\\) is the result.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recap the key steps:\n\n1. Expressed \\(\\binom{1/2}{2014}\\) as a product involving double factorials.\n2. Converted the double factorial into a regular factorial using the relation \\((2k - 1)!! = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}\\).\n3. Substituted back into the binomial coefficient and simplified step by step.\n4. Related the central binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\) to factorial terms.\n5. Carefully canceled out terms in the numerator and denominator, simplifying step by step.\n6. Arrived at \\(-\\frac{1}{4027}\\) after all simplifications.\n\nI think each step checks out. The key was recognizing the relationship between the double factorial and the regular factorial, which allowed me to express everything in terms of standard factorials and simplify accordingly.\n\nSo, after carefully going through each step and verifying the algebra, I'm confident that the result is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{4027}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{4027}}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the value of \\(\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}}\\).\n\nFirst, we recall the definition of the binomial coefficient for a real number \\(x\\) and a nonnegative integer \\(k\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{x}{k} = \\frac{x(x - 1)(x - 2) \\dots (x - k + 1)}{k!}\n\\]\nFor \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(k = 2014\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2\\right) \\dots \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2013\\right)}{2014!}\n\\]\nEach term in the numerator can be written as \\(\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\) for \\(n\\) ranging from 0 to 2013.

Using the relation \\((2k - 1)!! = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}\\), we find:\n\\[\n4025!! = \\frac{4026!}{2^{2013} \\times 2013!}\n\\]\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{-4026!}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\n\\]\nNext, we consider the central binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{4028}{2014} = \\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}\n\\]\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{-4026! \\times 2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\\right)}{\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}}\n\\]\nSimplifying step by step, we find:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times 2014^2}{2014 \\times 4028 \\times 4027} = \\frac{-2 \\times 2014}{4028 \\times 4027} = \\frac{-1}{4027}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{4027}}\n\\]",

The key was recognizing the relationship between the double factorial and the regular factorial, which allowed me to express everything in terms of standard factorials and simplify accordingly.\n\nSo, after carefully going through each step and verifying the algebra, I'm confident that the result is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{4027}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{4027}}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the value of \\(\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}}\\).\n\nFirst, we recall the definition of the binomial coefficient for a real number \\(x\\) and a nonnegative integer \\(k\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{x}{k} = \\frac{x(x - 1)(x - 2) \\dots (x - k + 1)}{k!}\n\\]\nFor \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(k = 2014\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2\\right) \\dots \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2013\\right)}{2014!}\n\\]\nEach term in the numerator can be written as \\(\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\) for \\(n\\) ranging from 0 to 2013. This product simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\prod_{n=0}^{2013} \\left(\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2^{2014}} \\prod_{n=0}^{2013} (1 - 2n)\n\\]\nThe product \\(\\prod_{n=0}^{2013} (1 - 2n)\\) results in \\(-4025!!\\), where \\(!!\\) denotes the double factorial. Using the relation \\((2k - 1)!! = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}\\), we find:\n\\[\n4025!! = \\frac{4026!}{2^{2013} \\times 2013!}\n\\]\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\\[\n\\binom{1/2}{2014} = \\frac{-4026!}{2^{4027} \\times 2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\n\\]\nNext, we consider the central binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4028}{2014}\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{4028}{2014} = \\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}\n\\]\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{1/2}{2014} \\cdot 4^{2014}}{\\binom{4028}{2014}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{-4026! \\times 2}{2014 \\times (2013!)^2}\\right)}{\\frac{4028!}{(2014!)^2}}\n\\]\nSimplifying step by step, we find:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2 \\times 2014^2}{2014 \\times 4028 \\times 4027} = \\frac{-2 \\times 2014}{4028 \\times 4027} = \\frac{-1}{4027}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{4027}}\n\\]",
