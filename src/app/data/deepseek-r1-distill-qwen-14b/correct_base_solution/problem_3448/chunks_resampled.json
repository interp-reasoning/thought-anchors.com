    "Wait, but 2014 terms starting at 1 and decreasing by 2 each time would end at \\(1 - 2(2013) = 1 - 4026 = -4025\\), which is correct.",
    "Let me think about how to express this product.",
    "I can factor out a \\(-1\\) from each term after the first one.",
    "Hmm, let's see.",
    "Let me see, how many negative terms are there?",
    "Let me note that the product of an arithmetic sequence can sometimes be expressed using factorials or double factorials.",
    "Wait, but since each term is negative except the first one, how many negative terms are there?",
    "Now, let's note that this product is similar to a factorial, but it's only the odd terms.",
    "But let me see if I can express this product in terms of factorials or double factorials.",
    "But wait, how many negative terms are there?",
    "I notice that this product is similar to a factorial but with only odd numbers.",
    "I can factor out a \\(-1\\) from each term except the first one, which is 1.",
    "I remember that the product of consecutive odd numbers can be expressed using double factorials.",
    "Let me see, the number of negative terms is important here.",
    "Hmm, that product can be written as:\n\\[\n(-1)^{2014} \\times (1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\dots \\times 4025)\n\\]\nSince each term after the first is negative, and there are 2014 terms, the power of -1 is 2014, which is even, so it becomes positive 1."
