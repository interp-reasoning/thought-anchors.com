The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? Solution: \n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the first few pages are single-digit (1-9), then two-digit (10-99), and then three-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there?\n\n   The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence in the units place is at 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, right? Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n   Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is.\n\n   The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set.\n\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189:10\n   - 280-289:10\n   - 380-389:10\n   - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\n   So, adding these up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 /10 =48.4, but since we include 4, it's 49 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800+ is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember in some problems, the hundreds place for 4 might not go all the way to 488, but in this case, it does because the book is 488 pages. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that in the hundreds place, the 4's appear 89 times, which is a significant number, contributing a lot to the total count of 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$",
