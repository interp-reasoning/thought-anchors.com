  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. So, applying the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be treated as a constant in this context?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each polynomial. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. \n\nThe binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), with a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so, because any other term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), those terms would not contribute. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients.\n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): that's 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. Correct.\n\nNext, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): that's 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's right.\n\nI think I got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.",
