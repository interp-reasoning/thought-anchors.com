    "So, the total coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial).",
    "So, if the second part has a term \\( c^k \\) with coefficient \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\), then when multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\), it becomes \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) with coefficient 6 * \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\).",
    "So, if the second part's expansion is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} \\), then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64.",
    "So, yes, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.",
    "So, if the second part has a term \\( c^k \\) with coefficient, say, \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\), then when multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\), it becomes \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) with coefficient 6 * \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\).",
    "So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, yes, I think my initial reasoning was correct.",
    "So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, yes, I think my earlier reasoning was correct.",
    "So, if the second polynomial has terms like \\( c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6} \\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients, then when you multiply by \\( a^2b^2 \\), you get \\( a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, \\) etc.",
    "So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.",

    "So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then multiplying by \\( a^2b^2 \\) would give you 64 * 6 = 384 as the coefficient for \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product.",
    "So, if the second part has a term \\( c^k \\) with coefficient, say, \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\), then when you multiply by \\( a^2b^2 \\), you get a term \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) with coefficient 6 * \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\).",
    "So, if the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then multiplying that by 6 gives 384.",
    "So, if the second part has terms with coefficients, say, \\( c^k \\) and \\( c^{-k} \\), then when you multiply by \\( a^2b^2 \\), each term becomes \\( a^2b^2 \\times \\) coefficient.",
    "So, for example, if the second part is \\( P(c) \\), then \\( a^2b^2 \\times P(c) \\) would have \\( a^2b^2 \\) multiplied by each term in \\( P(c) \\).",
    "So, yes, that makes sense.",
    "So, if the second part has terms with coefficients, say, \\( c^6 \\), \\( 6c^4 \\), \\( 15c^2 \\), \\( 20 \\), \\( 15c^{-2} \\), \\( 6c^{-4} \\), \\( c^{-6} \\), then each of these would be multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\), so the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) would be \\( 6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) \\).",
    "So, if the second part has coefficients \\( c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6} \\), then when you multiply by \\( a^2b^2 \\), you get \\( a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + a^2b^2c^{-6} \\).",
    "So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then multiplying that by 6 gives 384.",
    "So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.",
    "So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, if the second part has a term \\( c^k \\) with coefficient, say, \\( m \\), then in the product, \\( a^2b^2 \\times m c^k \\) would contribute \\( m \\) to the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2c^k \\).",
    "So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, yes, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, if the second part sums up to 64 when \\( c = 1 \\), then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.",
    "So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.",
