  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the expression \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\( (a + b)^n \\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\( (a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k \\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on \\( (a + b)^4 \\) first. I need the term that has \\( a^2b^2 \\). So, in this expansion, the general term is \\( \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\). I want \\( a^2b^2 \\), which means \\( 4 - k = 2 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\). So, the coefficient would be \\( \\binom{4}{2} \\).\n\nCalculating that, \\( \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \\). So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). So, I need to consider how the other part of the product affects this.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about how the two parts multiply together. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, I might need to consider each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nWait, but actually, the terms from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) are multiplied together. However, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\( c \\) and \\( 1/c \\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the variables don't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\).\n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) would be multiplied by every term in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\( a^2b^2 \\) doesn't involve \\( c \\) or \\( 1/c \\), so when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, it would create terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) or \\( a^2b^2/c^k \\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of the powers of \\( c \\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) times any power of \\( c \\)?\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\)\", but in the entire product, \\( a^2b^2 \\) is multiplied by each term from \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\( a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\) or \\( a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k} \\) for some \\( k \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\), because each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\( a^2b^2 \\).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\( a^2b^2 \\) is a term from \\( (a + b)^4 \\), and the other part is \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) would be the coefficient from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the entire expansion of \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of the powers of \\( c \\), then we would need to sum all the coefficients from \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) and multiply that by the coefficient from \\( (a + b)^4 \\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right either because \\( a^2b^2 \\) is a single term, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it creates multiple terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) can be found by setting \\( c = 1 \\). So, let's compute \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\( (a + b)^4 \\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) terms, only the \\( c \\) terms. So, when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) or \\( a^2b^2c^{-k} \\), but the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) itself in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the second part, you're adding a multiple of \\( a^2b^2 \\).\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Maybe I should consider that the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), so when you multiply, the coefficient remains 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the entire first part, so every term in the first part gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because when you multiply \\( a^2b^2 \\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term is a multiple of \\( a^2b^2 \\) times something involving \\( c \\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of the \\( c \\) terms, you have to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Because in reality, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\( c^k \\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\), not \\( a^2b^2c^k \\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) times any power of \\( c \\), which would require summing over all possible \\( k \\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6 \\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire expression, which would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\( a^2b^2 \\) times any power of \\( c \\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that since \\( c \\) and \\( 1/c \\) are separate variables, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be \\( a^2b^2 \\) times the entire expansion of \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) is the coefficient from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the sum of coefficients from \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2c^k \\) for some specific \\( k \\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\( a^2b^2 \\), regardless of \\( c \\), the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) is only present once in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it creates multiple terms, each with \\( a^2b^2 \\) times different powers of \\( c \\). So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try expanding both parts separately.\n\nFirst, \\( (a + b)^4 \\) has the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) with coefficient 6, as we saw.\n\nSecond, \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\( \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left( \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} \\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} \\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\( (a + b)^4 \\) by \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\), each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\). So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) with coefficient 6 from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) for \\( k = 0 \\) to \\( 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as calculated before.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) is indeed 64, as I found by setting \\( c = 1 \\). So, that part checks out.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Let me think of a smaller example to check.\n\nSuppose I have \\( (a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 \\). The expansion would be \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c \\). Now, the coefficient of \\( a \\) in this product is the coefficient of \\( a \\) times each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the coefficient of \\( a \\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\). So, the coefficient of \\( a \\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\( a \\) appears as \\( a c \\) and \\( a / c \\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the expression \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}.",

So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the expression \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}.",
