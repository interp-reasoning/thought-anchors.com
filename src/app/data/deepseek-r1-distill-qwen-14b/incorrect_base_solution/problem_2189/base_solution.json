  "solution": "Okay, so I've got this problem where a mother wants to arrange her plates around a circular table, and she doesn't want the two green plates to be next to each other. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the plates she has. There are 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. So in total, that's 5 + 2 + 2 + 1, which is 10 plates. Since the table is circular, the arrangement is a circular permutation problem.\n\nI remember that for circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is (n-1)! because one position can be fixed to account for rotations. But in this case, the plates aren't all distinct; there are repetitions. So I think the formula for circular permutations with identical items is (n-1)! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each identical item. So that would be (10-1)! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!) which is 9! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!).\n\nLet me compute that. 9! is 362880, and 5! is 120, 2! is 2, so 5! * 2! * 2! * 1! is 120 * 2 * 2 * 1, which is 480. So 362880 divided by 480. Let me do that division: 362880 \u00f7 480. Hmm, 480 goes into 362880 how many times? Well, 480 * 750 is 360,000, so subtracting that, we have 2880 left. 480 goes into 2880 exactly 6 times. So 750 + 6 is 756. So the total number of circular arrangements without any restrictions is 756.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she doesn't want the two green plates to be adjacent. So I need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two green plates are next to each other from the total number of arrangements.\n\nTo find the number of arrangements where the two green plates are adjacent, I can treat them as a single entity or \"super plate.\" So instead of having 10 individual plates, I now have 9 items to arrange: the \"double green\" plate, the 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, and 1 orange plate. But since it's a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange these 9 items is (9-1)! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!), because the \"double green\" is considered one item now. Wait, actually, the counts of the other plates remain the same except the greens are now one item.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The two green plates are now a single unit, so we have 1 \"double green\" plate, 5 blue, 2 red, and 1 orange. So that's 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 9 items. So the number of circular arrangements is (9-1)! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!) because the \"double green\" is one item, and the other counts are as before. So that's 8! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 40320 / (120 * 2 * 1 * 1) = 40320 / 240 = 168.\n\nBut wait, the \"double green\" plate can be arranged in two ways: green1 followed by green2 or green2 followed by green1. So I need to multiply this by 2, giving 168 * 2 = 336.\n\nSo the number of arrangements where the two green plates are adjacent is 336. Therefore, the number of acceptable arrangements where they are not adjacent is the total arrangements without restriction minus the adjacent arrangements: 756 - 336 = 420.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I treated the two green plates as a single unit, I considered them as one item, so the total number of items is 9, leading to 8! arrangements, but since it's circular, it's (9-1)! = 8! as I did. Then I divided by the factorials of the counts of each type, which are 5! for blue, 2! for red, and 1! for orange and the \"double green.\" Then I multiplied by 2 because the two green plates can be swapped within their \"super plate.\" That seems correct.\n\nSo the total arrangements without restriction are 756, and the arrangements with green plates together are 336, so subtracting gives 420 acceptable arrangements.\n\nI think that makes sense. So the answer should be 420.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves arranging 10 plates (5 blue, 2 red, 2 green, 1 orange) around a circular table without the two green plates being adjacent.\n\n1. **Total Circular Arrangements Without Restrictions:**\n   - Use the formula for circular permutations with identical items: (n-1)! / (product of factorials of each identical item).\n   - Total plates, n = 10.\n   - Calculation: (10-1)! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!) = 9! / (120 * 2 * 2 * 1) = 362880 / 480 = 756.\n\n2. **Arrangements With Green Plates Adjacent:**\n   - Treat the two green plates as a single \"super plate,\" reducing the problem to arranging 9 items.\n   - Use the same circular permutation formula: (9-1)! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 8! / (120 * 2 * 1 * 1) = 40320 / 240 = 168.\n   - Since the two green plates can be arranged in 2 ways within the \"super plate,\" multiply by 2: 168 * 2 = 336.\n\n3. **Subtracting Adjacent Arrangements:**\n   - Total acceptable arrangements = Total arrangements - Adjacent arrangements = 756 - 336 = 420.\n\n**Answer:** The number of ways is \\boxed{420}.",
