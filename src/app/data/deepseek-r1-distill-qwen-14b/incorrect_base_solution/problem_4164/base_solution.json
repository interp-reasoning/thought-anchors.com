  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find p(5) for a cubic polynomial p(x). The given information is that p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a cubic polynomial has the form p(x) = ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, d are constants. Since it's a cubic, it's determined uniquely by four points, which is exactly what we have here: four values of n (1, 2, 3, 4) and their corresponding p(n) values. So, in theory, I can set up a system of equations to solve for a, b, c, d, and then plug in x=5 to find p(5).\n\nBut wait, setting up four equations might be a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me recall that sometimes when dealing with polynomials that take specific values at integer points, we can consider constructing another polynomial that relates to the given one.\n\nLet me define a new polynomial Q(x) such that Q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is a cubic, x\u00b2p(x) will be a quintic (degree 5) polynomial. So, Q(x) is a quintic polynomial.\n\nNow, let's see what we know about Q(x). For x = 1, 2, 3, 4, we have Q(n) = n\u00b2p(n) - 1 = n\u00b2*(1/n\u00b2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. So, Q(x) has roots at x = 1, 2, 3, 4. That means Q(x) can be written as Q(x) = k(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - r), where k is a constant and r is another root because it's a quintic.\n\nWait, but Q(x) is a quintic, so it should have five roots, counting multiplicities. Since we already have four roots at 1, 2, 3, 4, there must be a fifth root, say r. So, Q(x) = k(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - r).\n\nBut I need to find k and r. Maybe I can find more information about Q(x). Let's think about the behavior as x approaches infinity. The leading term of Q(x) is x\u00b2p(x), which is x\u00b2*(ax\u00b3) = a x^5. On the other hand, the leading term of Q(x) as per its factored form is k x^5. So, matching the leading coefficients, we have a = k. But I don't know a yet. Maybe I can find another condition.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that Q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1. So, when x=0, Q(0) = 0\u00b2p(0) - 1 = -1. Let's plug x=0 into the factored form of Q(x):\n\nQ(0) = k(0 - 1)(0 - 2)(0 - 3)(0 - 4)(0 - r) = k(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-r) = k*(24)*(-r) = -24kr.\n\nBut we know Q(0) = -1, so:\n\n-24kr = -1 => 24kr = 1 => kr = 1/24.\n\nSo, kr = 1/24. Hmm, but that's one equation with two unknowns, k and r. I need another condition to find both.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the behavior at another point. Let's try x=5. Wait, but I don't know Q(5) because that's what I'm trying to find indirectly to get p(5). Alternatively, maybe I can think about the derivative or something else, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait another idea: since Q(x) is a quintic and has roots at 1,2,3,4, and r, perhaps I can find r by considering that p(x) is a cubic, so Q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 is a quintic, and maybe the fifth root is at x=0? Wait, no, because Q(0) = -1, which isn't zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe r is another integer? Let me test x=5. If I plug x=5 into Q(x), I get Q(5) = 5\u00b2p(5) - 1 = 25p(5) - 1. On the other hand, from the factored form, Q(5) = k(5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(5 - r) = k*4*3*2*1*(5 - r) = 24k*(5 - r).\n\nBut from earlier, we have kr = 1/24, so k = 1/(24r). Therefore, substituting into Q(5):\n\n25p(5) - 1 = 24*(1/(24r))*(5 - r) = (24/(24r))*(5 - r) = (1/r)*(5 - r) = (5 - r)/r.\n\nSo, 25p(5) - 1 = (5 - r)/r.\n\nHmm, but I still have two variables here: p(5) and r. I need another equation to relate them. Wait, perhaps I can find r by considering that Q(x) is a quintic, so maybe r is another integer? Let me see if r can be 0, but Q(0) = -1, so that's not a root. Maybe r is another number.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that Q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1. Since p(x) is a cubic, Q(x) is a quintic. Let me write Q(x) as:\n\nQ(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - r).\n\nI can expand this and compare coefficients with x\u00b2p(x) - 1. But expanding a quintic might be too tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can find r by considering that Q(x) is divisible by (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), so Q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(ax + b), since the fifth factor is linear.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was (x - r), but maybe it's better to write it as (ax + b) to account for any linear factor. Hmm, but actually, since Q(x) is a quintic, and (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) is a quartic, the fifth factor must be linear, so it's (x - r). So, Q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - r).\n\nSo, as before, Q(0) = (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-r) = 24*(-r) = -24r. But Q(0) is also equal to 0\u00b2p(0) - 1 = -1. Therefore:\n\n-24r = -1 => r = 1/24.\n\nWait, so r is 1/24? That seems a bit odd, but maybe it's correct. Let me check that again.\n\nQ(0) = (0 - 1)(0 - 2)(0 - 3)(0 - 4)(0 - r) = (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-r) = (24)(-r) = -24r.\n\nAnd Q(0) = -1, so -24r = -1 => r = 1/24. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now we have Q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 1/24).\n\nTherefore, Q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 1/24).\n\nNow, we can write Q(x) as x\u00b2p(x) - 1, so x\u00b2p(x) = Q(x) + 1.\n\nTherefore, p(x) = (Q(x) + 1)/x\u00b2.\n\nSo, to find p(5), we can compute:\n\np(5) = (Q(5) + 1)/25.\n\nNow, let's compute Q(5):\n\nQ(5) = (5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(5 - 1/24) = 4*3*2*1*(5 - 1/24).\n\nCompute 5 - 1/24: that's 120/24 - 1/24 = 119/24.\n\nSo, Q(5) = 24*(119/24) = 119.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, (5 - 1) = 4\n\n(5 - 2) = 3\n\n(5 - 3) = 2\n\n(5 - 4) = 1\n\n(5 - 1/24) = 5 - 0.041666... \u2248 4.958333..., but exactly, it's 119/24.\n\nSo, multiplying all together: 4*3 = 12, 12*2 = 24, 24*1 = 24, 24*(119/24) = 119.\n\nYes, so Q(5) = 119.\n\nTherefore, p(5) = (119 + 1)/25 = 120/25 = 24/5 = 4.8.\n\nBut in fraction form, 24/5 is the same as 4 and 4/5, but since the problem probably expects a fraction, I'll write it as 24/5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes when dealing with fractions, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, Q(5) = (5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)(5 - 1/24) = 4*3*2*1*(119/24).\n\nCompute 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nThen, 24*(119/24) = 119.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, Q(5) = 119, so p(5) = (119 + 1)/25 = 120/25 = 24/5.\n\nSimplifying 24/5, it's 4 and 4/5, but as an improper fraction, it's 24/5.\n\nSo, the answer is 24/5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using finite differences or Lagrange interpolation?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that p(x) is a cubic, so it can be expressed in terms of basis polynomials. But that might be more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since we have p(n) = 1/n\u00b2 for n=1,2,3,4, maybe we can consider that p(x) = 1/x\u00b2 minus some function that is zero at x=1,2,3,4. But since p(x) is a polynomial, 1/x\u00b2 is not a polynomial, so that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider that p(x) - 1/x\u00b2 is zero at x=1,2,3,4, but 1/x\u00b2 isn't a polynomial, so that might not help. Alternatively, maybe we can write p(x) = (something) that relates to 1/x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I think the approach I took earlier with Q(x) = x\u00b2p(x) - 1 is solid because it turns the problem into finding a quintic polynomial with known roots, which allows us to express Q(x) in factored form and then solve for the unknown root and constant.\n\nSo, I think my earlier solution is correct. Therefore, p(5) = 24/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( p(5) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{5}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a cubic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) that satisfies \\( p(n) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\), we need to find \\( p(5) \\).\n\nFirst, we define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1 \\). Since \\( p(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, \\( Q(x) \\) is a quintic polynomial.

Equating the two expressions for \\( Q(5) \\), we get:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24k(5 - r) \\]\n\nSince \\( kr = \\frac{1}{24} \\), we substitute \\( k = \\frac{1}{24r} \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24 \\left( \\frac{1}{24r} \\right) (5 - r) \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{24}{24r} (5 - r) \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{5 - r}{r} \\]\n\nWe solve for \\( r \\) by considering \\( Q(0) = -1 \\):\n\\[ -24r = -1 \\implies r = \\frac{1}{24} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{1}{24} \\) back into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{5 - \\frac{1}{24}}{\\frac{1}{24}} \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24 \\cdot \\frac{119}{24} \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 119 \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) = 120 \\]\n\\[ p(5) = \\frac{120}{25} = \\frac{24}{5} \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( p(5) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{5}}.",

Substituting \\( x = 5 \\) into the factored form of \\( Q(x) \\), we get:\n\\[ Q(5) = k(5 - 1)(5 - 2)(5 - 3)(5 - 4)(5 - r) = k \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (5 - r) = 24k(5 - r) \\]\n\nWe also know that \\( Q(5) = 5^2 p(5) - 1 = 25 p(5) - 1 \\). Equating the two expressions for \\( Q(5) \\), we get:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24k(5 - r) \\]\n\nSince \\( kr = \\frac{1}{24} \\), we substitute \\( k = \\frac{1}{24r} \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24 \\left( \\frac{1}{24r} \\right) (5 - r) \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{24}{24r} (5 - r) \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{5 - r}{r} \\]\n\nWe solve for \\( r \\) by considering \\( Q(0) = -1 \\):\n\\[ -24r = -1 \\implies r = \\frac{1}{24} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{1}{24} \\) back into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = \\frac{5 - \\frac{1}{24}}{\\frac{1}{24}} \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 24 \\cdot \\frac{119}{24} \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) - 1 = 119 \\]\n\\[ 25 p(5) = 120 \\]\n\\[ p(5) = \\frac{120}{25} = \\frac{24}{5} \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( p(5) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{5}}.",
