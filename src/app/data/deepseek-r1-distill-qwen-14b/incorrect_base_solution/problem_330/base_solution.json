  "solution": "Okay, so I need to compute this expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 times 4 is 12. \n\nWait, let me write this down step by step to keep track. Maybe I should label each level as I go.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 3*4 = 12\nLevel 3: (1 + Level 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLevel 4: 3*(Level 3) = 3*13 = 39\nLevel 5: (1 + Level 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLevel 6: 3*(Level 5) = 3*40 = 120\nLevel 7: (1 + Level 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLevel 8: 3*(Level 7) = 3*121 = 363\nLevel 9: (1 + Level 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*364 = 1092\nLevel 11: (1 + Level 10) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLevel 12: 3*(Level 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\nLevel 13: (1 + Level 12) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLevel 14: 3*(Level 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\nLevel 15: (1 + Level 14) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLevel 16: 3*(Level 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, let me check that again. I might have miscounted the levels because there are 9 sets of parentheses. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one set. Each time we go out, we add another level. So, let's count how many times 3 is multiplied:\n\nEach time, we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, no, wait, hold on. Wait, maybe I misapplied the levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more careful. Let me write each step clearly:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Then, moving outward, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). So, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next level out: 3*(1 + result from Step 2). So, 3*(1 + 13) = 3*14 = 42\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think. Wait, in the original expression, each time it's 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, maybe I should approach it as a recursive computation.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet me denote L1, L2, L3,... up to L9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I thought it was 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but in the previous attempt, I thought it was 3*(1 + 12). Wait, perhaps I need to correct my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous level). So, perhaps each level is built as 3*(1 + previous level).\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new level, so from the innermost (1+3), there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I have 9 levels.\n\nWait, but in my previous count, I went up to Level 9 as 36084. But when I computed earlier, I thought it was 29523, but that might have been a miscalculation.\n\nLet me try to compute each level again carefully.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 36084. But let me check if I have 9 levels correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is a new level. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many 3(1 + ... are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3(1 + ... until the innermost (1 + 3). So, counting the number of 3(1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Another 3\n4. Another 3\n5. Another 3\n6. Another 3\n7. Another 3\n8. Another 3\n9. The last 3 before the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's 9 levels of 3(1 + ... So, yes, 9 levels. So, my calculation up to Level 9 as 36084 seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried another approach, I thought I might have gotten 29523, but that seems to be incorrect. So, perhaps 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result should be 36084.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each level is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value at each level n, starting from the innermost as n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, same result. So, I think 36084 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nBut this seems odd because our a_n are all positive integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\na_n^{(h)} = A*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 3\n\nB - 3*B = 3\n\n-2*B = 3\n\nB = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*A\n\n11/2 = 3*A\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nBecause 11/6*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6, and -3/2 = -9/6.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 / 6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 into 216,504:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 / 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our step-by-step calculation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought the answer was 36084, but in the first approach, I thought I might have gotten 29523, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 1 + 15 = 16; then 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 1 + 48 = 49; then 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 1 + 147 = 148; then 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 1 + 444 = 445; then 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 1 + 1335 = 1336; then 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 1 + 4008 = 4009; then 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 1 + 12027 = 12028; then 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level as follows:\n\n1. Level 1: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Level 2: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n3. Level 3: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n4. Level 4: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\)\n5.

Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is a new level. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many 3(1 + ... are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3(1 + ... until the innermost (1 + 3). So, counting the number of 3(1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Another 3\n4. Another 3\n5. Another 3\n6. Another 3\n7. Another 3\n8. Another 3\n9. The last 3 before the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's 9 levels of 3(1 + ... So, yes, 9 levels. So, my calculation up to Level 9 as 36084 seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried another approach, I thought I might have gotten 29523, but that seems to be incorrect. So, perhaps 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result should be 36084.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each level is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value at each level n, starting from the innermost as n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, same result. So, I think 36084 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nBut this seems odd because our a_n are all positive integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\na_n^{(h)} = A*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 3\n\nB - 3*B = 3\n\n-2*B = 3\n\nB = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*A\n\n11/2 = 3*A\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nBecause 11/6*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6, and -3/2 = -9/6.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 / 6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 into 216,504:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 / 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our step-by-step calculation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought the answer was 36084, but in the first approach, I thought I might have gotten 29523, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 1 + 15 = 16; then 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 1 + 48 = 49; then 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 1 + 147 = 148; then 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 1 + 444 = 445; then 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 1 + 1335 = 1336; then 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 1 + 4008 = 4009; then 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 1 + 12027 = 12028; then 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level as follows:\n\n1. Level 1: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2.
