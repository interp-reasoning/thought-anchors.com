  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that an x-intercept occurs where y = 0, so I need to solve sin(1/x) = 0. I also recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = k\u03c0 for some integer k. So, in this case, 1/x must be equal to k\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) where k is a positive integer because x is positive in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(k\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of k.\n\nSo, substituting x, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve this inequality for k. I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive.\n\nFirst, let's take the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\n1/0.0001 > k\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10000 > k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSimilarly, taking the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000\n\nSo,\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, putting it all together, k must satisfy:\n\n318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nSince k must be an integer, k ranges from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nWait, let me make sure: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, here, a = 319 and b = 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers k between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 10000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by that is approximately 3183.0988618. So, k must be less than that, so the maximum integer k is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618, so the minimum integer k is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x = 1/(k\u03c0) are indeed in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSince when k increases, x decreases. So, when k = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is approximately 0.0009965, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded.\n\nBut wait, let me check x when k = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo total 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000.7128\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.7128 \u2248 approximately 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's a problem because 0.000099925 is less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, that means that k = 3183 gives x outside the interval. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound for k.\n\nWait, so let me correct this. When I set x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, so 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWhich implies that k\u03c0 < 10000, so k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, we need to find the largest integer k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k\u03c0 < 10000 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k such that x > 0.0001 is k = 3183 - 1 = 3182.\n\nWait, let's check k = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3183\u03c0 + 3182\u03c0) Hmm, maybe it's better to compute 3182\u03c0.\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128 - 3.1416 \u2248 9997.5712.\n\nSo, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9997.5712 \u2248 approximately 0.000100025, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's acceptable because 0.000100025 > 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum k is 319 because when k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5304) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so that's acceptable. Wait, no, 0.00099947 is approximately 0.001, but it's actually less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, 0.00099947 is 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the minimum k was 319 because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the next integer is 319.\n\nWait, let me check k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but if k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5304) \u2248 0.00099947, which is also less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nWait, but when k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, so k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, k must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nWait, but when k = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is still less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but when k = 318, x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k must be 319 or higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.\n\nWait, the inequality is 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, k must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nSo, even though k = 318 gives x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k = 318 is not allowed.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nThe original inequality was 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(k\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, even though k = 318 gives x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, but since k must be greater than 318.309, k must be at least 319.\n\nWait, but 318.309 is approximately 318.31, so k must be greater than that, so the next integer is 319.\n\nSo, in that case, k starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound is k < 3183.098, so the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw earlier, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k such that x > 0.0001 is k = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100025, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought k goes up to 3183, but that gives x below 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound as well.\n\nSo, to find the maximum k such that x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k\u03c0 < 10000 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100025 > 0.0001.\n\nSo, now, the range of k is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because I adjusted the upper bound.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nk starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought k goes up to 3183, but that's excluded because x would be less than 0.0001.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with k = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nAnd k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included k up to 3183, but that's incorrect because k = 3183 gives x outside the interval.\n\nSo, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.\n\n3182 - 319 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 300 = 2882\n\nThen subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but after adjusting, it's 2864.\n\nLet me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for x = 1/(k\u03c0):\n\nLower bound: 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nUpper bound: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001 => k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, but k = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182, which gives x \u2248 0.000100025 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nThus, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: sometimes when counting inclusive integers, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nLet me list a small example to check.\n\nSuppose I have numbers from 5 to 7 inclusive. How many numbers? 5,6,7: 3 numbers. So, 7 - 5 + 1 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the number is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0), because each oscillation is 2\u03c0 in terms of the argument of sine.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe function sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = k\u03c0, so x = 1/(k\u03c0).\n\nBetween x = a and x = b, the number of zeros would be the number of integers k such that 1/(k\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, in our case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/a = 10000, and 1/b = 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2864 because k = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nBut according to this formula, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but in this formula, does it include k = 3183?\n\nBecause when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formula should be floor(1/a\u03c0) - 1 - ceil(1/b\u03c0) + 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nSo, floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but why does the formula floor(1/a\u03c0) - ceil(1/b\u03c0) give 3183 - 319 = 2864, which is correct.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nWe need to find the number of k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nThis translates to 318.30988618 < k < 3183.0988618.\n\nThe integers k in this range are from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

I also recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = k\u03c0 for some integer k. So, in this case, 1/x must be equal to k\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) where k is a positive integer because x is positive in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(k\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of k.\n\nSo, substituting x, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve this inequality for k. I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive.\n\nFirst, let's take the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\n1/0.0001 > k\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10000 > k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSimilarly, taking the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000\n\nSo,\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, putting it all together, k must satisfy:\n\n318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nSince k must be an integer, k ranges from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nWait, let me make sure: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, here, a = 319 and b = 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers k between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 10000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by that is approximately 3183.0988618. So, k must be less than that, so the maximum integer k is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618, so the minimum integer k is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x = 1/(k\u03c0) are indeed in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSince when k increases, x decreases. So, when k = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is approximately 0.0009965, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded.\n\nBut wait, let me check x when k = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo total 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000.7128\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.7128 \u2248 approximately 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's a problem because 0.000099925 is less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, that means that k = 3183 gives x outside the interval. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound for k.\n\nWait, so let me correct this. When I set x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, so 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWhich implies that k\u03c0 < 10000, so k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, we need to find the largest integer k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k\u03c0 < 10000 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k such that x > 0.0001 is k = 3183 - 1 = 3182.\n\nWait, let's check k = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3183\u03c0 + 3182\u03c0) Hmm, maybe it's better to compute 3182\u03c0.\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.7128 - 3.1416 \u2248 9997.5712.\n\nSo, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9997.5712 \u2248 approximately 0.000100025, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's acceptable because 0.000100025 > 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum k is 319 because when k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5304) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so that's acceptable. Wait, no, 0.00099947 is approximately 0.001, but it's actually less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, 0.00099947 is 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the minimum k was 319 because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the next integer is 319.\n\nWait, let me check k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but if k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5304) \u2248 0.00099947, which is also less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nWait, but when k = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, so k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, k must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nWait, but when k = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is still less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but when k = 318, x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k must be 319 or higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.\n\nWait, the inequality is 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, k must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nSo, even though k = 318 gives x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k = 318 is not allowed.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nThe original inequality was 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(k\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, even though k = 318 gives x \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, but since k must be greater than 318.309, k must be at least 319.\n\nWait, but 318.309 is approximately 318.31, so k must be greater than that, so the next integer is 319.\n\nSo, in that case, k starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound is k < 3183.098, so the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw earlier, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k such that x > 0.0001 is k = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100025, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought k goes up to 3183, but that gives x below 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound as well.\n\nSo, to find the maximum k such that x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k\u03c0 < 10000 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100025 > 0.0001.\n\nSo, now, the range of k is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because I adjusted the upper bound.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nk starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought k goes up to 3183, but that's excluded because x would be less than 0.0001.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with k = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nAnd k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included k up to 3183, but that's incorrect because k = 3183 gives x outside the interval.\n\nSo, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.\n\n3182 - 319 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 300 = 2882\n\nThen subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but after adjusting, it's 2864.\n\nLet me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for x = 1/(k\u03c0):\n\nLower bound: 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 => k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nUpper bound: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001 => k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, but k = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182, which gives x \u2248 0.000100025 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nThus, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: sometimes when counting inclusive integers, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nLet me list a small example to check.\n\nSuppose I have numbers from 5 to 7 inclusive. How many numbers? 5,6,7: 3 numbers. So, 7 - 5 + 1 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the number is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0), because each oscillation is 2\u03c0 in terms of the argument of sine.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe function sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = k\u03c0, so x = 1/(k\u03c0).\n\nBetween x = a and x = b, the number of zeros would be the number of integers k such that 1/(k\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, in our case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/a = 10000, and 1/b = 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2864 because k = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nBut according to this formula, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but in this formula, does it include k = 3183?\n\nBecause when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099925 < 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formula should be floor(1/a\u03c0) - 1 - ceil(1/b\u03c0) + 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nSo, floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but why does the formula floor(1/a\u03c0) - ceil(1/b\u03c0) give 3183 - 319 = 2864, which is correct.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nWe need to find the number of k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nThis translates to 318.30988618 < k < 3183.0988618.\n\nThe integers k in this range are from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Convert the interval bounds to inequalities involving \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   0.0001 < \\frac{1}{k\\pi} < 0.001\n   \\]\n\n2.
