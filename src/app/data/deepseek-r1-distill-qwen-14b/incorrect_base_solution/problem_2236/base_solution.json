The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? Solution: \n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider all these cases: 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Then, I'll sum them up for each digit and compare.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in the units place across all page numbers.\n2. Count the number of 4's in the tens place across all page numbers.\n3. Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nThen do the same for 8's and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the 4's.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers: 0-9, 0-9, etc.\n   - For each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n     - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 sets give 48 fours.\n   - Now, check the partial set (481-488). The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in this partial set.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers.\n   - For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n     - From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks give 5*10=50 fours.\n   - However, I need to check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 488 is beyond 449, yes, all five blocks are complete.\n   - So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive?\n     - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nNow, summing up all the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\n**Now, counting 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Same as before, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights.\n   - Partial set: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n   - Let me count the number of complete blocks:\n     - 80-89: 10 numbers\n     - 180-189: 10\n     - 280-289: 10\n     - 380-389: 10\n     - 480-488: 9\n   - So, how many complete blocks of 10? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\nNumber of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems quite a large difference. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n- Units place: 48. Correct, because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in units place, so 48 is correct.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n- Units place: 48 complete sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: Blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9, total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers have one 4. There are 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and a partial set (481-488) without a 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with a 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers have one 8. There are 48 complete sets and one in the partial set (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 187\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{89}",
